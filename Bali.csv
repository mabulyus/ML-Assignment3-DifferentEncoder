0,"We stayed at the Eastin Ashta for 2 weeks at the end of June. Within 24 hours we had decided we would definitely come back. The staff are just amazing. Every one of them. All smiley and happy. From arrival to departure. They would ask us how we were whenever we passed them and when we left or returned to the hotel. Great service at the pool all day with towels provided. Food was very good and the frozen cocktails were delicious. Me and my husband got sick for a day while there, nothing to do with the hotel. We think it was from our trip to the monkey sanctuary. Anyway the staff were so helpful and made toast for me at lunch time and a 'chip butty' for dinner as I couldn't eat anything else and  kept asking if we were ok. Breakfast was good. I ate far too much bacon. So crispy. The staff take your order for eggs however you want them.Room was a perfect size with a comfy king bed. You can have your sheets changed daily if you wish or leave a card provided on the bed to say you don't require a sheet change. The cleaner kept the room clean and  left towel art every day and 2 free bottles of water.  Shower was a walk in and great size. Small balcony which we only used to dry clothes and towels. Yes the room lighting is dull but a lot of hotels are like this. I always take a plug in bulb for extra light. Sockets are universal so no need for convertors. We managed with wardrobe space for a fortnight and I take travel fold up coat hangers for extra clothes hanging. Air con was brilliant. Even had to turn it off sometimes. Fridge kept drinks nicely chilled. WiFi was better than our own at home and free. Hired a scooter and kept it in the hotel car park which was very safe. There was a hotel security guard by the car park who would always say hello too.The construction work did not bother us at all as it can't be seen from the outdoor restaurant or pool just from the balconies.The hotel is in a great spot near the beach and away from the noise at night from the clubs. Lots of nice places to eat and drink within walking distance. We liked The Lawn, Tugu, Deus, Echo Beach BBQ, Beach Boy, Grass Terrace and Fat Mermaid. Lots of beach bars with bean bag beds if you want to sun lounge and watch the sunset. If your young and want late nights and music go to the Island Beach Bar (called Desoner in the evenings)  a 10 min walk along the road in line with the beach or Luigi's Hot Pizza a similar distance but left up the street  from the hotel. The people of Canggu are so friendly and polite. From shops to beach bars to restaurant. Never met an unfriendly face anywhere. And no one is pushy here. I recommend taking an unblocked mobile phone and getting a sim there so that you can use data for Google maps when you are out and about and so you can use the gojek app for taxis. We hired a driver for the day to to go to Ubud for the waterfalls and monkey sanctuary and he also took us to a lovely restaurant that  he recommended. Was about £35 for the whole day and he would just wait in his car at each stop.   We hope to return to the Eastin next year if our son is still there 'traveling'. He loves Canggu so much that he doesn't want to leave and we can see why. Such a chilled out place with so many friendly people.Makasih to everyone at Eastin Ashta. We had a great time. From Jon and Gina. ","July 12, 2019","0    Eastin Ashta Resort Canggu

1,"Excellent facilities, kind and welcoming staff. Only criticism was loud banging of doors at night, and thin walls so could hear next door / above and below. Poolside area perfect and gym was excellent. Great location near the beach.","July 9, 2019","0    Eastin Ashta Resort Canggu

3,"Loved the location of this hotel, a close walk to bars, restaurants, shops, yoga and the beach but far enough away that it was quiet on the premises. Pool was lovely and clean. Not much shade around the pool if you want to avoid the sun, but great if you want to soak it all in! Room facilities were fantastic, everything is modern and clean. Only issue I had was not being able to call a Blue Bird taxi from the hotel itself when I was leaving to move to Seminyak. Staff offered me the hotel transport but this was more expensive so instead I had to walk down the street with my suitcase and hail from the road which wasn't very convenient. Apart from this, I would definitely recommend a stay here! ","June 29, 2019","0    Eastin Ashta Resort Canggu

4,"I've stayed in this hotel 3 times and I've enjoyed my stay on all of those times. The hotel located deep inside Canggu and is walking distance from the beach. It is surrounded by small stores, restaurants and cafe, so it was really easy to find food just by walking.The room was big and can fit an extra bed nicely. The pool area is great if you're looking to sunbathe cause it's open so sun exposure was maximal.Breakfast was good. I definitely feel relax there. ","June 27, 2019","0    Eastin Ashta Resort Canggu

5,"It was my first stay in Canggu and my friend has picked out this boutique hotel for our short 2.5 days stay. The room is relatively spacious and comfortable and it was at a prime location, not too far from many good eating places which are within walk-able distance. It is also a stone's throwaway from the beach which was extremely excellent and must say a good spot to stay if you are surfing! the pool is awesome as well with bean bags and tanning chairs. would definitely be back to stay at this hotel again!","June 27, 2019","0    Eastin Ashta Resort Canggu

6,"Very clean and new hotel. Within walking distance of the beach and nice restaurants nearby. Never had so friendly staff in a hotel and everything was incredibly clean! Scooters also delivered via the hotel within an hour, great!Had a nice stay.Few small points for improvement- Rooms are very noisy, we heard the people walking above us and the people next door coming home and talking at night.- Do not wash clothes at the hotel! Washing 1 piece of underwear at the hotel is just as expensive as washing 1 kilo at a laundry shop.- Arranging a taxi through the hotel is much more expensive than arranging it yourself.","June 26, 2019","0    Eastin Ashta Resort Canggu

7,"Thank you very much and good karma for the housekeeping staff ( Surya ) my hubby accidentally left his wallet, when we came back the wallet still there - none missing. Love the location, very close to our favourite surfing beach, the staffs are very kind from the receptionist till the securities staffs - love the room most especially the rain shower , always feeling fresh after spending some time on the beach, aircon is good , bed is comfy, food and drink are overpriced & the swimming pool water not fresh , feel itchy bit after swimming, the bathroom amenities is standard . we lost our helmet in parking park hotel ( underground park ), the security said they will find it, but until we checked out still no helmet found , we end up pay rp 100.000,- to motorbike rental.","June 24, 2019","0    Eastin Ashta Resort Canggu

8,"Just finished a 6 night stay at this hotel and it was a pleasure from start to finish. We were welcomed on arrival, helped to our room with bags and everything explained clearly to us on breakfast times, pool times etc. The room was very spacious and clean, mini bar fully restocked every time you use something and if you ever need anything else any member if staff are willing to help.The pool staff are very helpful and happy aswel! Always making sure your okay for drinks/food and always happy. The only MINOR thing I can say about the hotel was the choice of food at breakfast. Not much choice at all apart from your basics, which is enough but I expected a little more. BUT this does not let the hotel down in any way, it is only a little criticism. Would defiantly stay again if I re visited Canggu!!","June 21, 2019","0    Eastin Ashta Resort Canggu

9,"I had the worst experience ever in a hotel. This hotel has complete disregard for the hotel guests. What happened on the last day spoilt everything.On my last day, i was in a rush to get to the airport. For convenience sake, i booked a car using the grab app. I mean it's cheaper, faster and more convenient for me. The most unfortunate thing happened, the hotel lobby guys or security guards stopped the car from entering. They then refused the driver from leaving even when i was inside the car. They told the grab drive to ask me to leave. I was stunned because i felt really unsafe.I understand the standing feud between grab drivers and local taxis in Bali. If it was a local taxi guy who stopped me, fair enough. BUT it was the hotel staff which made me extremely unhappy. As hotel staff, you should accomodate to your guests every requests. Your guests are your priority not the local taxis. I find this unacceptable coming from a hotel who would prioritise local taxis over their own guests. The whole situation made me so upset. I was really late for my flight. They made me walk out all the way to the main road with my luggages. Can you believe it?I highly do not recommend this hotel.","June 20, 2019","0    Eastin Ashta Resort Canggu

The pool area is large enough that it never gets too full to swim or find a lounger, and as a bonus they place great music. The best part about this hotel in my opinion is the location. You’re less than a 2 minute walk to the beach. As well as less than a 5/10 minute walk to the main area of Canggu with tons of delicious restaurants, cafes, and beach clubs.

13,I stayed here for a week with friends and the hotel is in a great location. The staff are friendly and helpful. The room was very spacious and clean. I used the gym and it was basic but plenty of equipment to get a good work out done. The food by the pool was delicious and generous in size also with very reasonable prices.

19,"Easy to walk to the beach or into town. Didn't need a scooter as the hotel is well situated between several places to grab a good dinner, cafe, shop, book a surf board, or just explore Canggu. My recommendation though is if you do find a good driver, book them to take you on tours, to your next hotel, or to the airport. Mr. Putu is my recommendation, he is a professional driver, not a taxi. +62 878-6170-4792 is his WhatsApp.. Great guide and driver.","May 26, 2019","0    Eastin Ashta Resort Canggu

20,"Taxi mafia situation in Canggu is ridiculous. A local taxi from the hotel to airport costs 375,000 IDR. Almost double that of bluebird. The hotel cannot do anything except to advise its guests to walk all the way to the main road if you want to take Grab, GoJek or Bluebird. Extortionist.

Rooms were large and spacious and aesthetically pleasing; the grounds were beautifully maintained; and the staff were friendly and accommodating - housekeeping even left me a very nice note after my first night's stay. One minor detail that could be improved upon is that the lighting in the room was dim especially in the evenings. Overall, though, a great stay and the price was an absolute bargain.

35,"Great experience! My boyfriend and I stayed four nights for about $400 USD. The hotel is gorgeous, very clean. The furniture in the lobby is a bit dirty/dusty looking but of course that’s from the hundreds of travelers bringing sand and dirt into the hotel from the beach. The location is OK. If you’re just staying here for the beach, it’s a perfect walking distance. But, as far as other things, there isn’t much to do within a good walking distance. A lot of stray dogs in the area, only places very nearby are an alcohol store, beach stores, and yoga places. But obviously that has nothing to do with the hotel itself. We booked a deluxe room which was on the fifth floor. Our room was gorgeous and very clean. The only thing is, the shower room is level with the rest of the hotel room. Our drain was clogged the first day, so our hotel room was FLOODED afterwards and some of our belongings got soaked. The next day, maintenance came to unclog the shower, and it was better - but the drain is still slow. Don’t use multiple functions at once on the shower head or water will escape the shower room at least a little bit. We had to stick a towel under the door for the entirety of our stay. Also, there was a very strange lingering diarrhea smell in between the shower room and the bed. It was there since we got there, not sure what caused it, but I ended up sleeping on that side of the bed so I’d consistently smell it if I ever reached on the bed stand to pick up my phone or whatnot. May have just been our room with the problems. But overall, this was a beautiful resort and I recommend it. The dining hall is gorgeous, clean and the food is good. I only wouldn’t recommend getting mie goreng there because they add way too much salt. The pool is gorgeous, is cleaned by hand daily, and the water temperature is perfect. They have a gym as well.

36,"We loved our stay here. The service is impeccable and the staff are lovely. It has everything that you need on-sight and is very close to most other things. It is a short walk to Echo beach and from our exploring we felt like it was on the best street, as it was close but also quasi-quiet. The street is quieter, but still includes coffee shops, restaurants, cocktail bars, and scooter hire. It just does not have the hustle and bustle of the other streets similarly close to the beach - but you can walk to the busier streets if you want too. Breakfast was fantastic. Changed everyday to keep it interesting. Food was fresh and tasty, and they make eggs, pancakes, and waffles to order. It’s a buffet, with western/eastern foods. We spent hours everyday at the pool, and loved the cocktails at the bar (2-4-1 between 5-8pm). Room was clean. Bed was soooo comfortable. Cleaned everyday at a time you could choose if this was more suitable. Going back to service: they assisted us with private transfer to and from the airport. Even when we landed at 2am and when that flight was cancelled. We hadn’t paid for breakfast but when we missed a night I asked if we could transfer that money to breakfast and they very kindly agreed. They made re-booking extra nights easy, and assisted us with private car for day trips. I cannot recommend this place more.","April 13, 2019","0    Eastin Ashta Resort Canggu

You can hear construction work right near the hotel from your balcony, people walking up and down the hotel corridors as well as room doors slamming and people talking in their rooms - the walls must be thin. we came here as a family but it seems mainly for couples and singles even though there is a kids crèche. Canggu is not really a family friendly location...the streets are hard to walk on with kids as they are so busy and narrow. Not sure what the hype of Canggu is - it is a dirty, party area. If your looking to come here with family- rent a nice villa away from the hustle and bustle","April 10, 2019","0    Eastin Ashta Resort Canggu

38,"Very nice hotel, clean and well maintained rooms, very helpful staff. Hotel provided us with airport transfer and rented us scooter, so we didnt have to take care of anything. Large pool is also very nice and clean providing enough space for all guests, with pool bar (prices are higher than in other restaurants in canggu).Only minus would be the running construction work right next to the hotel. They are building there a huge resort, working from early morning till late evening and it can be disturbing when sitting on balcony or at pool.","March 27, 2019","0    Eastin Ashta Resort Canggu

39,The Easton hotel is located only minutes from the beach. The staff are very attentive and friendly. The restaurant has a great breakfast and dinner menu (we did not try the lunch menu as we were out during the day). The rooms and the entire hotel are very well kept and clean. There is some new construction going on in the neighborhood but the noise was not too loud.,"March 26, 2019","0    Eastin Ashta Resort Canggu

40,"Eastin Ashta Resort are a beautiful new development in Canggu, in an excellent location and with gorgeous sunset views by the pool. I highly recommend the in-house green tea scrub as well as lemon facial (perfect for any pigmentation from sun exposure). The breakfast is by far the best I of anywhere I stayed in Bali, with a generous buffet selection catering to both Indonesian and Western tastes. The hotel seems to be fantastic for families, with an on-site creche for little ones, whilst you escape to the beach just a short walk away. There are some lovely little bars and restaurants by the coastline which are ideal for watching the sunset in the evenings, it's also much less busy than some of the other stretches of shoreline. There is also a business centre should you desire a quiet place to work. Wifi and connectivity were fast and accessible, which can be a rarity around Bali!Should you rent a car or scooter, they have their own car park with free parking to keep this safe. Overall I cannot rate my stay with Eastin Ashta any higher, the exceeded all expectations and i would definitely be staying with them again on my next visit to Canggu.","March 22, 2019","0    Eastin Ashta Resort Canggu

46,"Myself, my husband and my 8 month old son just returned from a holiday in Bali, we stayed at the Eastin for 2 weeks. We don’t usually write reviews but the staff were so wonderful we felt we needed to let prospective customers know! From the moment we arrived the staff couldn’t have been friendlier, they treated my son like their own family. A particular thanks to reception staff Herry who was so wonderful with us and our son, he went far above and beyond what we expected. Herry absolutely made our stay even more brilliant than it would have been and I hope the management recognise what an exceptional member of staff they have. The room was beautiful, the hotel was so clean you could have eaten your food off the floor. The pool area was wonderful, my son used the playroom daily and my husband used the gym (both situated right next to the pool), and there was a great massage place opposite. The hotel was situated very close to the beach where we enjoyed sunset every evening. Overall I could not fault the Eastin and I would highly recommend it to anyone heading to Bali. The only suggestion I could make would be for the hotel to put a sail or cover over the baby pool as the floor around the pool got so hot my son (and other children) couldn’t walk or crawl around out of the water. Thanks for the wonderful stayKaty, Tom and Jensen ","March 3, 2019","0    Eastin Ashta Resort Canggu

47,"Ok, me and my bro are taking a break from work and going on a holiday to Bali at the end of January for 3 days. We stayed at Eastin Astha Hotel, it takes less than an hour from the airport to the hotel. It is located in Canggu area. I think this is the best place you should choose to stay when you go to Bali, since it is close enough (I think) to every other place you'd want to visit. We choose to stay in Canggu area since it’s been boring lately in Kuta, Seminyak, Legian, etc, just the usual bar/club hoppers activity, it’s kind of dull for me personally.When we first arrive to Eastin Astha Hotel and checked in, we get an upgrade from a superior room to a deluxe room, of course we took it, but.... we got one king size bed, well... this is a bit awkward, two dudes, sharing one king size bed... but since it's a free upgrade and we got a much bigger and comfortable room, I think we could make it work. Just draw the line where you can't cross and we will be fine, and several other rules... (Not worth mentioning, but to summarize it is, just stay away from each other when we are in the room, LOL)We checked in, the staff are very friendly here, helping us carry our luggage to our room (thank you), and then explain all the features in our room. We ask for a smoking room, we get a room with a balcony, when you open the sliding door to the balcony, the air condition automatically turn off (Cool right!), so you can open the sliding door and just start smoking without any concern of anything, and after you finish, just close it, and turn the air condition on again. We ask why they made it like this, is because the Eastin Astha is intending to become an eco green energy saver resort. And the other thing that surprise us are, they said that some of the food ingredient they used were planted and managed by themselves in their garden (soo Cool!!)That night we then go to Echo Beach Grill and Bar, I highly recommend for all of you to go to this place… the meals are so good and the price are actually pretty cheap considering you get a buffet for rice, salad, potatoes, and the others (i can’t remember really..) to choose, and you can take it as many times as you want, while enjoying the beach at night. We spend those 3 days mostly just touring around the area and then back to our hotel for relaxing… well, maybe most of the time we spend it in the hotel since it’s just too comfort, fast wifi, good food, a big swimming pool, highly professional and very polite staff member. We would most definitely go back again staying at Eastin Astha. We recommend you guys to also try and stay at this Hotel.","February 27, 2019","0    Eastin Ashta Resort Canggu

The bed was very comfortable and there was good housekeeping every day with 2 free bottles of water, plus tea and coffee. There’s a fridge, in room safe and flat screen tv with a couple of western channels. The only minor negatives were the room was showing a bit of “wear and tear” and the curtains let in light in the morning. Throughout my stay the staff were lovely and I was able to leave my suitcase in storage whilst visiting Java. They also helped me print boarding passes for flights and book Blue Bird taxis, which are metered, and work out half the price than standard taxis in the street that you have to haggle over the fare. The hotel is located on a side street just off the main strip so it’s quieter but you still have bars, restaurants, spas and supermarkets within 50 metres. It’s also less than 10 mins walk to the beach. In summary for the price it’s excellent value with friendly, helpful staff. ","November 6, 2018","1    Hotel Terrace At Kuta

Unfortunately it did not really fix the issue the aircon just was not adequate.We still slept every night with no sheets or bed covers to be comfortableYou need to leave a keycard oin a reader to leave the power on and their solution was to give us a spare keycard to leave in there so the aircon run all day.We also reported the bar fridge was not working only to be informed it was not actually a fridge but a cooler????.The manger had a proper all be it noisy fridge put in the roomThe breakfast was average to say the least with no real variety & the restarant if you call it a restarant is only open till 2pm.(Not a restarant at all just a basic kitchen)The deck around the pool is dangerous with nails & screws poking out & loose boards & why the pool closes at 7pm is beyond belief .Our normal hotel has a similar set up with rooms close to the pool and it is open till 10pm.This hotel just has no ambiece but is good if you just want a cllean room to sleep in>,"October 18, 2018","1    Hotel Terrace At Kuta

75,"We stayed in Kuta at the end of our trip to Bali due to its closeness to the airport and were pleasently surprised by this hotel. The rooms were very modern and clean, and very comfy bed with good size bathroom and shower. The location was good, far enough away from the street to be quiet and 10-min walk to the start of the beach and shopping centre. The staff were helpful and allowed us to print our boarding passes and Visas for the next leg of our trip. Thank you!","September 30, 2018","1    Hotel Terrace At Kuta

76,"Terrace hotel is a great place to stay if you want to be close to the center of Kuta. It is a modern style hotel located a short way down Jalan Benesari so it does not get all the traffic noise of the main drag but is only a couple of minutes walk from lots of good bars and restaurants including a couple of my favorites 'The Pad Bar on Legian' and Kooters bar and grill which is just across the roadHotel itself is comfortable, clean and quiet. The staff are friendly and helpful. My room was a good size and very clean. One thing to note was that there is only a couple of English TV channels which were Nat Geo and History channel from memory. The nice looking pool area is quite small compared to larger resort style hotels but while I was there it was not busy and there was always a lounge available.Breakfast was basic but had more than enough to enjoy a good meal before heading out for the day.All in all for the price Hotel Terrace gets a thumbs up from me and I would stay there again.","September 19, 2018","1    Hotel Terrace At Kuta

78,"Some negative reviews here confuse me as I found my stay to be very comfortable and relaxed.I had initially booked for 3 nites and ended up booking for a extra 2 as I enjoyed my stay so much.I was given a quiet room on the 5th floor , my room was spacious and clean , my bed was very comfortable, I got a great nights sleep each nite and the wifi was very good too.Bathroom was clean also with the shower steaming hot when I needed it.My room was cleaned very well each day as I had the same friendly housekeeper each day.I never had breakfast included in my rate choosing to visit many of the restaurants within walking distance each morning.Hotel Terrace is in a fantastic location , there is a good money changer within 50m , some good spas across the street also.This hotel is excellent value for money and I can see myself returning.","September 4, 2018","1    Hotel Terrace At Kuta

86,"I stayed here for 11 nights as a single parent with 2 children and felt completely safe throughout the stay. We had 2 pool access interconnecting rooms. I got a great deal for them, so was surprised at how good the rooms were for the price. Hotel and security staff were always friendly and helpful. The rooms were cleaned well daily. The sun only reaches one side of the sunbeds and only for a few hours but that’s pretty standard in Bali and didn’t ruin our experience. Plus you’re in Bali - so much to see! The pool was nice and well kept. We ate out for breakfast as a bit pricey compared to nearby eateries when you’re on a budget and 3 of you. Used the snack bar for lunch a few times and was well priced and nice. Location is great. You can walk to most places. Beach was a 5 mins walk, Waterbom and discovery mall about 30 mins walk. The beach walk mall about 15 min walk. There are LOADS of places to eat nearby all with different price ranges. From ridiculously cheap to ridiculously expensive. TV had a good few English channels.

Did not have breakfast included but decided to have on last day only as had a long day ahead. OK. Simple no frills but pricey for what they offered. Go to the main road for cheaper better options unless included. Location wise perfect for main street. Restaurants, bars, shops and massages on your doorstep!

I do recommend getting a room on the top floor. We were unlucky and had some people above us banging around all night. I had to change rooms at 4:30 am! Not really the hotels fault but still. The other annoying thing was that the air-con units are all attached to the exterior walls surrounding the hotel which gives the feeling of sleeping in a washing machine.

104,"I never used charming in all my reviews, but this hotel is an exceptional!I've stayed here for 5 nights and for the price I've paid, i think its worth much more than I could ever imagine.First, you guys shud know that even though this is a small hotel, but it is squeaky clean everywhere!! The room was extremely comfortable and clean and so does the bathroom. The room is very spacious for 2 people and most of the rooms has small balcony which i think is really really neat looking down at the swimming pool. You can enjoy the tranquility of Balinese air in the morning and dusk at the balcony. All rooms have big sliding door unlike most similar hotel which only have small windows. TV channel was ok and aircond was also working nicely as it is a split unit.Every staff you'll meet at the hotel were very courteous and helpful. And if you ever wanted to rent a motorbike, the hotel gave the cheapest rent rate compare if you rent from any other place. They serve breakfast for USD5 but i think the breakfast was mediocre so we only had it one time and ate outside most of the times.The swimming pool sit in the middle of the hotel and it is beautifully preserves and maintained. I suggest you to take a dip at sunset around 730pm where it is really peaceful and you can truly enjoy this hotel.The last thing i wanna highlight to you guys is the location of this hotel which is very important regardless the niceness of the hotel. Well, the location is smack in the center of the lively Legian, but not on the main street. You have to deviate around 250meter from Legian main street to reach this hotel which was reasonably ok to me. And you have to walk around 1.2km to go to the beach along the narrow back roads of Legian. So you see, if you want to stay in Legian for all its Bar and happening things especially at night but still want to stay in a more peaceful hotel without hearing any of those noise, than this is perfect hotel. But if you prefer your hotel near to the beach of want to hear the sound of waves upon waking up, than please look for other hotel at Kuta area. One thing you guys shud also know when you rent a motorbike and stay in this hotel, most of the road in Legian are one way and cramped with pedestrian and motorbikes, so its not easy to navigate to get back every evening so be extra careful.","December 14, 2017","1    Hotel Terrace At Kuta

Though the rooms are very small and the triple bunkbed is a bit too much for such a small room. We didnt know we had toleave our big backpacks outside of the dorm and take in only the things we needed. We found this very inconvienent for us. The bathrooms were good and the common area wasnt too bad either. The food was okay but most of my friends and i got sick after eating from here and we had to wait ages to eat, for example 6 of my friends would have eaten after already waiting ages and I had to wait 30 more minutes until I got my meal, it was so late some of my friends had headed off to sleep!","September 15, 2017","2    Canggu Beach Hostel

128,"I'll start by saying, I wouldn't reccommend this hostel. I'll elaborate on why:-My partner got bitten by bedbugs all over her legs, feet and back! After reporting it, nothing was done about it other than stripping the bedsheets. She slept in my bed for the reminder of the stay to avoid further creepy crawleys. Avoid bed 8 downstairs main building!!- The bathrooms were not cleaned as regularly as stated. Workers came and built dividers in our adjoining bathroom, leaving sawdust, tools, bamboo and general rubbish. This left it out of action for most of the time. The upstairs showers were low in water pressure.. but the worst thing to find was a used tampon in the shower. Something about the memory of streams of red around your feet before you notice why still gives me shivers. This was STILL there the next day! -The hostel isn't best located, around Echo beach is much closer to all the other bars and restaurants. The hostel food is ok.. but there is way more choice and selection around Echo beach.- Lots of staff... but not very efficient. Hands up to Ian behind the bar.. one guy working his socks off by himself! Even when it was really busy. 24 hour reception is not true.. one couple arrived at 12am and had been waiting for 3 hours before one of the other guests pointed them to a free bed (ironically bed 8.. the bedbug one)- the socialising areas are a little restrictive compared to other hostels I've been toThere are some merits to the place though, the scooter hire is cheap and efficient, the drinks relatively cheap and food was ok (albeit variable in time to arrive)","September 14, 2017","2    Canggu Beach Hostel

130,"So we booked 3 nights at the Canggu Beach Hostel. 2 days before arriving we requested the pickup service at the airport that the hostel proposes for 250k (the highest price you could pay, you can negotiate a local taxi for 230k easy). When we arrived no taxi was here to pick us up. We phoned the hostel and they said ""we have a problem with our taxis, you have to take a taxi on our own sorry"". Since they have their own drivers that we're working completely fine when we arrived an hour later our wonder what kind of problem they had. But fair enough, we negotiated a taxi for cheaper we weren't that unhappy, it happens.When we arrived at the hostel, it took 45 minutes to check in. Now, the hostel likes to say that it's because there are a lot of people which is true sometimes but when we arrived there was one person in line in front of us and two staff at the check-in. It took a lot of time because the check-in process is extremely long and the staff extremely slow. Then they asked for our credit card, I've been travelling 3 weeks in Indonesia and 2 months in SE Asia and this is the first time a hostel ask me for my credit card although we booked through an online booking website.Anyway, we finally check in and get to our room, and of course, the room was not done. The floor was full of sand and hair and the sheets had not been changed from the previous guests. So we go back to the reception and ask them to tidy the room. One of the staff says ""I'll personally make sure the room is perfect, wait for 30 minutes"". We come back 30 minutes later, sheets were changed and clean but of course the floor was still full of sand and hair. We ask them to redo it again and finally they get it right the 3rd time! The shower pressure is very weak, so my girlfriend ask them to turn it up so she could wash her hair. They said ""ok we'll call the maintenance guy"" of course 20 Minutes later the pressure is still very weak so we go ask again and they answer ""sorry the maintenance guy just left to the airport to pick up guests"" (I wonder why they couldn't pick us up then).Anyhow staff is not trained at this hostel and really inefficient, except the barman outside he really rocks, is smiling and efficient. Transport service (private shuttle) is really overpriced, you can find way cheaper. And it's the only place where we did not get a private bathroom along with the double room. TL;DR go to another hostel, you can find much better for much cheaper. PS: hope the management will not answer this comment in a sassy manner as they usually do. This hostel could be great but there are things that need to be addressed.PS2: a hello or even a smile from the manger would be greatly appreciated :) ","July 20, 2017","2    Canggu Beach Hostel

131,"Front desk staff confirmed a price on internet and then did not honour that price. Insisted on higher rate when I tried to book within 48hrs of them confirming a lower rate. I booked a private room for a month at a different property. They agreed to a rate in writing and then refused to accept that the booking.

139,"Thought I'd start this if with a quick snippet about the place. I wasn't aware of this until I had arrived. I question a place that needs to offer freebies to get a good review.  The Pros: -The Hostel is nice, fairly clean and has a bar/ food area and outdoor pool.  -They offer scooter hire at the same price as everywhere else (50,000 a day) -The food was pretty good with a decent selection -They have a card system so you essentially run up a tab until you leave the Hostel. THE CONS-They enforce a policy whereby you have to leave your Backpack in a Shed away from the Bungalows. They offer (the noisiest)plastic bags to put your belongings in to take to the rooms. It is apparently because of Bed Bug prevention. I understand that. The flaw in this is that you still take all your clothing up with you which is equally as likely to contain them as your backpack should you have the misfortune of Bed Bugs. This therefore is just a massive inconvenience having to go back and forth to this shed. - The check in & out takes ages! It's so over complicated. - The tab cards. In ways they are a Pro but as a group they all charge to the same account so you have to break down all of the costs and pay that way. - They prohibit the use of Uber, Grab, GoJek and Bluebird Taxis to pick you up and you have to use theirs, which from the quotes is got were more expensive. This is also something necessary as the Hostel is quite a ways out of town. - The Pool area is pretty run down and the outdoor area along with the common room is nowhere near large enough for the guests they accommodate, this made worse by the location so many don't go out. - With the small amount of areas to sit its worsened by the 3 high bunks. You can't sit in them as they are stacked so close together. - Two of our friends arrived late due to a delayed arrival and no one was around but security who were insistent they had no booking despite us already being there, explaining the situation and who the booking was under. This meant my wife had to get up at 2am to prove they were with the same booking. Bonus Comment- most of the people in the Bungalow we stayed in were left with little to sleep. This because of two couples decided to have sex on and off from 3am-7am. Granted this isn't a hostel fault but considering how seriously they took all the policies they didn't seem to take the one of prohibiting other people into the rooms as seriously.","May 26, 2017","2    Canggu Beach Hostel

142,"I will start by saying this hostel uses a tab system which is okay for a solo traveller. However we had a party of 6 and all individual tabs where kept under the same name which made it confusing when paying at the end!! The food is great here and reasonably priced considering. The location means that your gonna have to get a scooter out while you are there which come at a cost of 50k which is okay. The pool area is lush it's nicely kept and chilled. Also another system is they do not allow you to take bags into the rooms, as they say it stops bedbugs. This can make it a bit of trek to your bags if you are in the top bungalow.

148,"A good place if you want a get away near the black beach (5 mins walk). The bar staff are really friendly and the food is yummy! Go in prepared that you'll have to hire bikes/ bicycles to venture out to Canggu's main town. Hiring a bike for the day is no more than £3 here. They light up candles at night around the pool where you can sit and drink your happy hour drinks. The rooms are clean and my bed sheets were changed every night staying there. However, if you want to try more Indonesian food you'll need to fish around as it'll be a lot more cheaper and quicker service in a less busy environment.","April 7, 2017","2    Canggu Beach Hostel

150,Lovely place with cool little bungalow type dorms. Nice pool with lovely clean toilets and hot showers. Amazing food and friendly staff! It's a little far out the way but you can rent scooters to and have a good day out.

151,A fantastic hostel with a great social scene. A little out the way but a 15 minute scooter ride (available for rent at the hostel) will get you to all the great spots in Canggu. Being able to get to the beach with such a short walk is very beneficial. Especially if you're into your surfing. Highly recommend and comes at a great price. ,"April 6, 2017","2    Canggu Beach Hostel

153,"I booked this for 2 nights but extended it with the offer they had on. This was you pay 90k for 3 more nights and get the 4th free. It's such good value. The hostel is so clean, your beds are made every day and if you need a new towel you just ask. The room has an automatic mosquito spray. I arrived at 5am the security checked me in so there's no problem with late arrivals. Location wise it's about a 10 minute walk to the beach. It's about 10/15 min taxi or scooter ride to the 'centre' (good places are dotted all over the place in canggu) you can hire a scooter from the hostel for only 50k a day. It has a nice pool area. You get a free gym membership which is a 2 minute ride down the road!Only downside I would say is that it could do with a bigger bar/relaxing area which would make it easier to socialise at night.

156,"Forget about just staying in a normal boring hostel, this one is spectacular, 10mins with the scooter to the town, 2 mins walking to the beach, the set up is amazing for meeting travelers, have a game around the pool or a chat with others, after speaking to Alex one of the most professional owners i have seen in Bali hostels about sharing some of my performances at his hostel to make guests happy and he was absolutely supportive and guests were truly happy to be invited to the shows! Staff are unbelievably helpful, the new chef gives a delicious touch with his new menu, barman was doing his magic with a very very good prices for shots and cocktails, Likes: Almost everything - Dislikes: Three bunk beds, many out of control drunk travelers noises which actually happens in almost all hostels. However they still offer you private rooms if you needed to have a special night, i have shared a very very good memories at this place! Defo my fav in Canggu!

The hostel has got a really chilled out vibe, with an superb poolarea to relax at in between the surfingsessions. They are really serious about potential problems with bud bugs, so if that's a concern for you, this is the place to be. Everything is really clean and tidy, with a very welcoming and assisting staff. Would for sure recommend this place to everyone! ","March 11, 2017","2    Canggu Beach Hostel

The view from the restaurant is breathtaking and the food there is delicious and affordable. We had a couples massage that only cost about $10/each USD that was wonderful. We had cappuccinos delivered to the pool in the morning while we read, and the villa is within walking distance of most everything in Sideman. Only a quarter mile up the road are delicious warungs with views of Agung. Sideman is what Ubud probably once was, without the crowds and the trash. And the place is owned by a family from the area, not internationally owned, which is a plus. If you are going to Bali, you MUST go to Sideman and if in Sideman, you will not be disappointed with Sawah Indah (which means beautiful rice fields).","May 16, 2019","3    Sawah Indah Villa

168,"The hotel is surrounded by nature and close to rice fields still tended by local rice farmers (dont go to talalangan rice terrace its a tourist trap near ubud, instead go on a rice field walk in sidemen and you'll get the real experience - we went with wayan a local man who works at his cousins warung near the hotel)We stayed in room 2 lovely spacious room with a great view from the balcony and it had an outdoor bathroom! having an outdoor shower was fun!I went to the spa twice. First time my boyfriend and i had massages - you can have massages together and are asked to put on paper pants. The massage was good and the therapist asked if it was comfortable enough so you do get chance to ask for a firmer or lighter massage. Second time i went alone for the body scrub with flower bath - loved it! you get 15 mins in the flower bath (after the scrub) to relax and its so peaceful. The spa is a wooden cottage on stilts in the gardens its only small and in a pretty, natural setting. Food - we only had breakfast though really tasty and a good variety. We ate dinner in the local warungs and we would have drinks at the hotel restaurant before going out. Its fine to sit at a table and just have drinks.The pool was great, towels are provided and theres a telephone next to the towel cabinet for ordering drinks/food. Also they serve a complimentery afternoon tea - tea and fried banana etc. we really enjoyed our stay at the hotel and sidemen still has a traditional way of life.","November 19, 2018","3    Sawah Indah Villa

169,"We are a couple living in Bali (Ubud) for many years and wanted a little getaway for the weekend. This hotel gave everything we expected. Service: it was getting used to again for us to be a tourist. Normally we avoid tourist places. The service was great. Personal greeted us politely whenever we saw them and they did a lot of effort to make us feel comfortable. Bringing food and drinks at the pool, changing the gasbottle for the hot water and filling out water bottles in the restaurant. Nothing seemed a problem to them. 5 stars!Infinity pool: I must say that the management does it clever with the main photo on tripadvisor to be an old one. If you look carefully you can see that a lot of photos are from 2013. Since than the hotel has grown but the pool is still an amazing place to hang out during the day. 5 stars!Room: we had room nr 4 and we got exactly what we booked. The room was spacious with a large outdoor balcony. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was also very nice. We personally like this style of furniture and rooms. 5 stars!Restaurant: also a lot different than on one of the first photos from 2013. It's a lot better. A large spacious restaurant on the first level gives you an great view of the surroundings. Prices and quality are average but the atmosphere makes up for it. Yes you can go to cheaper warungs in the street and we did also but we can reccomend to dine at least one evening here. Breakfast was fine Choice out of a western or indonesian breakfast. Indonesian cuisine is not western so don't expect a breakfast as you would get in a western hotel. No complaints. 4 stars!Spa: as we live in Bali (and as masseur myself) I know it when I have a good massage. The traditional Balinese massage we got were average. Not bad but it could be a lot better. The price was reasonable for hotel standards but to high if you put it next to the quality. The spa itself looked very nice. 3 stars!What we really liked was the surroundings of the hotel. It's in the middle of ricefields where the local people just work. It's like watching a play and a nice mix of hotel guests and locals just doing what they do on a daily base. Also we were happy that we could refill out waterbottle. Bali has a real plastic waste problem so we try to be aware as much as possible. The hotel does provide small water bottles to every room and I wished they stopped doing that. But it made us happy that refilling our bottles wasn't a problem.","November 11, 2018","3    Sawah Indah Villa

The villagers work in the fields and it gives a nice atmosphere. The place has a nice restaurant, reception area, swimming pool and recreation area. We took the small bungalow, but it was too small, so we upgraded to a big one. It was well worth the extra money. Very spacious, well-built and well-integrated in the landscape. Not only the Sawah Indah villa was nice, but the surrounding properties as well. All the development in the Sidemen community is done in a aesthetically pleasant, non-intrusive way. Me and my wife need good WiFi to do our work and the WiFi was great. The staff in the restaurant is very friendly and professional and the food is healthy and tasty.

193,"First thing I would like to say is that there are a lot of older photos included when viewing this hotel online. The pool is not that open anymore and everything around the hotel has expanded. So, it is not as scenic as you would think. Ok, besides that the hotel grounds are very well kept and there are plenty of plants to look at which made me happy. Best selection I've seen so far in Bali. We stayed in a villa which was the furthest away from the reception desk and restaurant which was kind of nice, except for when the neighbor hotel restaurant starts paying their live band than its loud. The pool was nice, water was the coldest around which is nice on a hot day. People rave about the restaurant but I thought it was mediocre. I had to have ribs twice in a row because their selection was low. There are a lot of warungs within walking distance so don't be worried. The staff is friendly but one of the day managers rubbed me the wrong way like he didn't want to be there. Don't be surprised to see the cleaners lounging in the empty rooms next to you. Seems like it's there hideout spots from the boss. Overall it was good here. Would I come back? Probably if I was in a pinch. Oh and you are in the country. Lot of bugs but surprisingly very little mosquitos.","January 18, 2017","3    Sawah Indah Villa

194,"Love, love Sidemen. Wow. The diversity of Bali continues to surprise me even after 15 trips in 8 years. Planned to see Sidemen as part of a road trip of East Bali and what a treat the whole area was. Sawah Indah Villas in this village was truly fantastic. We had a deluxe room near the pool and loved it. It was a decent size, with an enclosed verandah with a day bed, a balcony and an open air bathroom, which we love to have in Bali. Bathroom also had an enormous bath. The room was clean and bright and airy and we spent lots of time on our balcony enjoying the exceptional views. We also loved the infinity pool - great size for the number of villas and plenty of pool lounges. Breakfast here was delicious and plentiful. We had both our evening meals in the on site restaurant and found the food and service to be of very high standard, without the price tag. We will definitely be visiting here again.","December 26, 2016","3    Sawah Indah Villa

Sitting to have breakfast every morning at the restaurant was a lovely experience. I did the early morning rice field trekking which I thoroughly enjoyed. I also did a day trip to the East Coast arranged through the hotel with a driver which was great. The food and drinks were delicious, but I think the thing that made the whole place was the staff. Never have I had nicer staff at a hotel. Thank you so much for making my holiday a happy and relaxing time.","December 16, 2016","3    Sawah Indah Villa

198,"We loved the time we spent at Sawah Indah and food in hotel was very good - breakfast freshly cooked although not wide choice. Evening meals excellent although again choice could be greater. We stayed only 2 nights. We felt that 3-4 nights would have been perfect. Absolute tranquility lying by the lovely infinity pool.We booked basic room which exceeded our expectations for the price. All very clean although you share with Geckos and variety of insects. Bedroom quite compact and not a lot of storage space, bathroom large and with shower but no bath. Great views from balcony over rice fields. I would recommend consider paying a bit more for villa with larger bedroom and balcony to make most of views. And rooms above ground floor have better views. There is an infinity pool with approx 8 loungers poolside and a few more on grass terrace below pool. Breakfast was freshly cooked to order and good whilst somewhat limited choice. Evening meals excellent although again a bit limited in choice. Chicken wrapped in leaves and pork ribs both excellent. Next door is an excellent Warung as an alternative. Other Warungs nearby. There is a temple within 200m which has regular celebrations in both day and evening but need to make sure ladies cover up bare arms and both women AND men need to wear a sarong.Sidemen village feels like authentic Bali. Fighting cocks in cages, rice and other food stuffs being dried on mats in sunshine, Arak being brewed, fields of rice, chillies, papayas, fruits etc. We booked a guided tour through rice fields with local resident Kadek (see separate review). Highly recommended in order to get a real understanding of village life. When we go back to Bali we will be sure to go back to Sidemen.","November 12, 2016","3    Sawah Indah Villa

It was a beautiful room and would work very well for a family of four. The pool area was lovely with an infinity pool looking towards the stunning view of the rice fields with the mountains in the distance. The breakfast was reasonable and cooked to order, with fruit, juice and choice of eggs, pancakes or cereal. We ate dinner both nights at the resort and the food was excellent and good value. Nice touch that they come to your room beforehand to see if you are eating dinner and take your order and time you would like to eat so it's ready when you arrive. Helpful friendly staff. Would recommend if you are looking for a relaxing few days in the country.","November 7, 2016","3    Sawah Indah Villa

No air con or Tv which was fine but we used the mozzie net & opened the balcony doors for more air flow. The evenings are cooler here & there is a ceiling fan.

201,"Sawah Indah far exceeded my expectations! It was the cheapest accommodation we stayed in during 5 weeks in Bali and one of the best (equal in my estimation to the most expensive villa we rented). The design of the one bedroom bungalow was really cozy yet spacious and breezy - so much outdoor space with the patio and the bathroom split into indoor and outdoor sections. There was even a fountain next to the outdoor shower. The wooden interior and crisp white finishes meant that we loved coming back to relax in the villa.The view of the rice fields is impressed upon my mind, weeks after we left. One of the staff, Made, told us that Sidemen is most beautiful in rice season so we should come back another time to see the rice plants waving in the breeze. I loved admiring the vegetable crops they rotate with rice, though - chills, corn, snake beans, eggplant, even tiny pineapples grew on the property!The restaurant was also gorgeous - on the first floor with hanging vines and the same great views. We really enjoyed the food as well - lots of vegetarian options for us for dinner. We tried other nearby warungs and after waiting over an hour for disappointing food, we vowed not to leave the villa for our evening meal. They have a great system of offering to take your order around 6pm in your room so that food is ready when you arrive at the restaurant at your nominated time. The home baked bread and homemade pineapple jam at breakfast were highlights too.The ONLY downside I noticed initially is that there are no coffee and tea facilities in the room BUT as soon as I mentioned this to my partner, a staff member knocked on the door telling us it was coffee break time. Every afternoon they offer you free tea or coffee which they deliver with fried pineapple or banana! It's sweet gestures like this that made me fall in love with Sawah Indah. I'd enthusiastically recommend it to anyone and happily stay again. ","October 29, 2016","3    Sawah Indah Villa

202,"Although our room was not very large (but we knew this when we booked and it came with a large terrace), it was very comfortable and equipped with a fan, fridge and safe. The bathroom was fine too, with a cold water shower but who needs hot water in 30 degrees anyway?All of this is located beautifully, with a view of a small valley with rice fields and a few other villas. Here comes a little point of warning: the main photo of the pool area on most website must have been taken a while ago: although it is still a very pretty place the swimming pool is certainly not as in the middle of only rice fields as it looks like on that photo. There are now far more other plants but also other buildings surrounding it.There is a nice restaurant with a good breakfast on site, and food and drinks are also served by the pool (which is nice and large by the way). The Spa is located in a very pretty hut with a great view, and various other restaurants are in walking distance. Also recommended is a guided walking tour through the rice fields - it even included wading through a shallow river a few times.All in all a very nice place, and especially considering the price highly recommendable for a nice stay in the Balinese countryside.","October 22, 2016","3    Sawah Indah Villa

204,"We stayed at Sawah Indah Villa for five nights, just a bit too long in our opinion. 3 nights would be more recommendable. The room (Deluxe) we had was nice and large with an outside bathroom. The bathroom was rather outdated and needs an update. The white walls are dirty and tiles lost their color as well as the wooden cabinet doors of the sink. The power socket in the bathroom did not close off the hole in the wall properly. The wires therefore were visable and could be exposed to water. When emptying the bath, the bathroom floods for 70 er cent. So, work to be done here. This is also the case for the swimming pool in my opinion. The wood adjacent to the pool, as you can see on the hotel's profile picture on Tripadviser, is not as nice as it looks on the picture any more. Some tiles have fallen off the sides of the pool and some tiles in the pool itself were missing as well. During our stay, the pool was not very clean and not completely filled. As if the filter system wasn't working properly. So, no infinity pool for us. Besides that, the picture suggests that there are not so many houses around, not so much true (anymore). More villas have been built and another hotel has been built on the top.When it comes to the restaurant, breakfast is just great! You can pick anything from the menu. Fresh juices, fresh fruit, pancakes, french toast, you name it. Breakfast however seemed to be the only good thing about the restaurant besides that the staff is friendly and they really seem to have much fun with each other. We had lunch and dinner at the hotel and, unfortunately, we can not be very enthousiastic about it for lunch and dinner. My girlfriend ordered a vegetarian ceasar salad at the restaurant. No meat in there indeed. However, there was a larve and louse in the salad. Then I checked my lettuce, same. Not the first time in Bali, so check your lettuce or just eat it without checking :-)Although the reveiw might give you a negative impression of this place, it is not bad at all. It is a great place to stay in Sidemen and we would certainly recommend this hotel. You only need to be fine with a lot of insects and reptiles. But what do you expect when you stay between the rice fields?! The hotel needs just a view updates to become ""excellent"" for me.","September 25, 2016","3    Sawah Indah Villa

Price-quality this is really incredible: the family room is huge (easily 5 persons in 3 bedrooms!), nice terras, nice bathroom in open air, ... And also the restaurant, spa and organized activities were better than expected (in quality terms) and very well priced. I obviously can find details that can be improved - but I will save these for reviewing Oberois and peers when I pay their prices...This is a gem, just like it's location. Don't know for how long, but if you're a family that wants to see some of the old Bali, join farmers through their ricefield trips, I suggest to take this into your Bali tour for a couple of days (2, 3 nights is enough). Tip: being a Bowie fan, I wanted to see the house in Iseh where he stayed some decades ago. It's right here - just rent a motorbike (it's safe here unlike Ubud or the beach cities) and cruise around: just awesome sceneries!","August 24, 2016","3    Sawah Indah Villa

First of all, we fell in love with the white wooden hut, we have all the clean amenities provided by the hotel. Even mosquito net was clean and have no suspicious chemical smell. We had one warm welcome by the cocroach which probably coming when we opened the window.When we arrived, the staff greeted us nicely and we had a nice fresh welcome drink. In the afternoon we also had this fried banana fritters and coffee/tea as complimentary from the hotel, we were wondering if we had the compliment due to the ceremony in the village which were not allowed us to do much outside our room. Best bet was either to join the ceremony (walking around the village) or stay in the villa. Staff were always nice and they did recommend us to take local guide if we want to explore the village, as the track might be tricky and we might get lost without local guide. Bathroom was rather sexy because they have semi open air bathroom. It was spacious and clean, so we enjoy good bath time. Because our room was next to staff's room thus we heard their noise, but still acceptable because they just chat nicely and it didn't last long. Not very long after, we heard the gecko and cricket sound back as our lulaby.Overall we love our stay! It was a loving romantic yet adventurous stay we had.","June 18, 2016","3    Sawah Indah Villa

213,"We spent two nights here - one on the top floor by the pool (deluxe double) and one downstairs (standard double) as the first room was booked out for the second night. I would definitely recommend the deluxe room - the room was very spacious and nicely decorated in a traditional style, the bathroom was quite cool and semi-outdoors, and we had a lovely terrace overlooking the rice fields. The standard double was still good value but definitely not as impressive, as it was quite small in comparison. There was less light generally and felt less private as well, as we were on the ground floor.There are only a few downsides with the villa itself - the food (both breakfast and dinner) was average, our showers were usually only hot for 1-2 minutes before going cold, and wifi was poor. On balance though, we would stay here again in a heartbeat. The service was always lovely and we loved our stay here, and importantly we loved our time in Sidemen - after spending a couple of days in Ubud, Sidemen and the surrounding villages were definitely refreshing and felt so much more authentic. Definitely recommend both Sidemen and Sawah Indah Villa!","June 11, 2016","3    Sawah Indah Villa

The hotel was clean and the beds were comfortable. The pool was amazing. We hiked up Mt. Agung on the second day and after I received an incredible massage at their spa. The staff was kind and helpful. My laundry was done quickly and they did a great job. There is no need for air conditioning because keeping the side doors open and sleeping under the mosquito net is a wonderful feeling. The only small complaint I have is the food. I would rather eat more authentic balinese food for breakfast and didn’t think what I did order for dinner was very good. There is a restaurant next door to the hotel that is delicious.

217,"Exceptional value for money and set in an ideal location, very close to dream beach, devil's tear and Sandy bay beach club. The staff were very friendly and helpful. You can hire a scooter direct from the reception. Breakfast was simple, but fresh and tasty and cooked to order. Food and drink at the restaurant are the cheapest we've found in Bali. There are several other bars and restaurants within easy walking distance. The pool and gardens are beautiful. The outdoor bathroom to the villa was clean, attractive, and fully functional. The bedroom, while pleasant was dark with poor lighting and the bathroom door wouldn't stay shut unless locked, which can only be done from the bedroom side. The mattress and pillows were very comfortable, and the linens and duvet clean. The interior of the room could do with a deep clean. The sockets were grubby as well as the light switches and corners of the room. The air conditioning worked perfectly. Overall, this is an excellent place to stay and the negative points are only minor, but could be rectified very easily. We are currently staying in a rather expensive hotel on a different side of the island and would much rather be back at the Cubang huts where everything was much better for a fraction of the price.","May 17, 2019","4    The Cubang Hut's Lembongan

218,"My husband and I stayed here for two nights while visiting Nusa Lembongan. The check in process was easy and our villa was cute and quaint. The outdoor bathroom was great, however just know that the shower doesn’t get hot. It’s luke-warm. Besides that little nuisance of the shower, the hotel is literally steps away from Dream Beach which has great food and drinks overlooking the ocean. The pool seems to always be a nice temp. which is awesome when you want a quick dip. Our breakfast at the hotel was great with prompt service! Through the hotel we were able to book a day trip to Nusa Pendia with a private driver that took us to 4 different beaches.

The stacked pool and fountains were so nice to see. As we checked into our villa it seemed a little mundane. Aside from the huge cockroach that crossed my tablet late at night, the overall review is that it’s just a place to rest your head and sit by the pool. It is right in the middle of the devils tear, dream beach, and a short distance for surfing.","March 18, 2019","4    The Cubang Hut's Lembongan

We were welcomed warmly to our adorable villa which was clean and had AC which was extremely important to us. You are less than a 5 minute walk from Dream Beach and a few restaurants. Caution as we were unaware of how quite this area of the island gets at night and there is no street lighting to navigate to some other local restaurants and bars. That being said, this is the perfect remote getaway if that is what you are looking for. The restaurant food is delicious and the staff kindly served us breakfast even an hour before the kitchen opened. We enjoyed our short stay here! ","October 24, 2018","4    The Cubang Hut's Lembongan

Big shout out to Suma who helped us out even before we checked in and met him. The food in the restaurant also is customised to your taste and made to perfection. It's right next to dream beach and devil's.tear which are popular tourist attractions. Cons: it's far away from.all the action and has no vibe. If you are looking for a quiet retreat this is great but if you want to be in the thick of action this place is quiet dead. On the other hand, lempongan is tiny and a scooter can get you anywhere in no time. So this place is value for.money in that sense and very clean too.

Strong air conditioning if you need it. Friendly service that helped book us a snorkelling tour and motorcycle etc. The island is small and the location of the huts is by the best beach on the island (though dream beach isn’t swimmable because of the strong current).

Devil's tear is also on walking distance.Rooms: We stayed in the hut farthest from the reception. (5th hut). The huts are wooden built and are spacious enough with a comfy bed and a sofa as well. The huts have outdoor bathroom which are very comfortable with both hot and cold water.The locks of the doors could be improved. AC works very well as well.Food: We had dinner on the first night (ordered pizza, sandwich and a juice). We repeated the juice and couldnt resist having dinner the next night as well.

Checking in was quick and easy with cc (3% surcharge) being accepted and Suma and the other friendly staff making sure you were aware how your room safe & other appliances worked, informing on local attractions & what time breakfast was served from. Once we'd settled in & although in full awe of our 'huts' (large bed, mozzie net, a/c, couch, outside shower/toilet/vanity, balcony, minibar & hot beverage making facilities) & how new and fresh/modern they appeared we had a quick swim in the pool whilst our nasi gorang was being cooked fresh in the kitchen. Once full of food, we realised we were fading rapidly and requested scooters to hire for our duration to explore the island further. & this would have to be one of the highlights of staying here - nothing was too much effort for the friendly staff to assist with, whether it be getting bookings made for excursions or recommendations of places to visit.Wifi was good, accomodation & location was excellent and the Bintangs from the bar were always cold - what more could one want...","July 11, 2017","4    The Cubang Hut's Lembongan

266,"The Mansion is advertised as a 5 star hotel, in my opinion it has declined into a depressing, disappointing hotel, struggling to even retain a 4 star rating. Some of the reasons for this feedback:-wifi drops out, inaccessible most mornings and evenings. Had really impacted my ability to do a few things I’d planned to get done, especially in the mornings. Apparently, their wifi does not support Apple products very well?!!-breakfast buffet - food often runs out/gets cold. There is no proactive attention by staff to things needing to be refreshed, cleaned, looked after (reoccurring theme here of a reactive service vs proactive)! -The actual property (and rooms) are aged. In fact, the entire property comes across as being neglected and in need of a renovation.-The staff did not have the usual skip in their step, they seemed tired/indifferent. Lovely people when you actually need something, however, they did not seem happy and think this might contribute to their general apathy and lack of being proactive.With such a large property I was quite surprised by the lack of guests. Not many around. Following our first day, I began to experience a feeling of the place being a bit of a ghost town. Sprawling grounds, lots of space, plenty of service staff, but very few guests and many of the wellness related areas are closed!Sadly, my family and I would try and find things to do to leave the hotel and return late in the day to avoid the frustrating poor wifi and depressing atmosphere.","June 18, 2019","5    The Mansion Bali

This isn’t the hotels fault, but there were problems with the communication from the staff. In the end the manager was very helpful and resolved the issue to my satisfaction. Drinks and food are a bit overpriced, but I guess you pay for convenience. It’s not centrally located and not really possible to walk anywhere so you need a taxi or the shuttle to get into town.

The room provided to us was huge but it definitely needs a bit of renovation as the age is clearly visible in all aspects . The bed is huge and comfortable for 3 including a child . Resort provides a shuttle to main Ubud central area every 2 hrs and that’s very comfortable and good way to explore Ubud market area . Food at Hotel is very average and breakfast should be revamped to include more international cuisine .

Omelette station good but limited choice other than cereal for our daughter. Noise from adjourning rooms - you can hear everything due to shared roof space.

275,This has been one of the best surprises that I have had. I was not expecting to find a 5 star location with a 5 star staff and grounds. Whoever own this jewel is by far dedicated and passionate. The grounds are second to none ( I say that as I travel only in high end 5 star resorts). The rooms are slightly 1990ish but not bad at all and they are remodeling a bunch of them. We stayed in the Governer's rooms and they were spectacular. I want to place a shout out to Krisma who is one of the kindest front desk clerks I have seen ever. She is so sweet and helpful. The management should be very happy with her. All in all this hotel is by far more than the 4 it has currently.

276,"The Mansion Resort and Spa, along with the new wellness center on site is a must-visit, an iconic unique experience I will always remember and keep coming back to now that I've been lucky to discover it (after a couple trips to Bali! Can't believe I didn't visit it before).I stayed here for a week so far and am still discovering more amazing amenities and beautiful artistic places to relax, work on my laptop, read, heal, rejuvenate, or take photos/videos. The whole place is a like a work of art with stunning design, craftmanship, gorgeous details and special touches that are inspiring. Definitely not a cookie-cutter or modern-western type hotel where you could be anywhere. It's an impressive and rejuvenating mix of sustainability, nature, art, luxury, wellness, and spa services with 6 pools, 3 restaurants, fitness center, B12 shots and IVs, hammocks, hot tub, .... plus quite an array of weekly events like yoga and aerial silks, zumba, and special workshops. I only realized today they use a special non-chlorine cleaning system for the pools that actually infuses healthy minerals into them, no wonder its so refreshing. Admittedly I haven't left the resort much this week as there's so much to explore and experience :-) Maybe next week I'll take the free shuttle into town but I also want to swim in all the different pools, try the B12 shots, more of the classes + wellness elixirs, spa services and take more photos. Especially of their new Plumeria restaurant that has such a inspiring majestic beautiful feel to it. They have daily drinking water provided in a glass bottle rather than one-time use plastic, not sure if this is for every room but I would think so. Oh and no plastic straws. Enjoying the warm friendly staff and magical pathways and how they honor the local traditions and cultures yet worldclass international quality.

278,"We booked The Mansion as a treat to finish our five months of travelling in South East Asia and to celebrate our engagement but we were sadly more than disappointed with our one week stay.Firstly, we booked the “Villa Residence” accommodation option. We arrived to be provided with the “modern” style room within the “Villa Residence” which was no more than a poorly decorated sub standard room. They did kindly put some petals on the bed and some towel art, which was nice, just a shame the room was not as advertised!). The half open air bathroom was lovely with a large tub but the rooms are advertised with photos of the wooden “traditional” Balinese style villa huts and not the awfully styled “modern” rooms. Do not be fooled, these “modern” style rooms should be in a totally different category to the “traditional” style Villa Residence rooms, they are not on the same level and shouldn’t be categorised together especially with misleading photos! Thankfully, one of the “traditional” Villa Residence rooms was available so we were moved promptly. I feel sorry for the other couples who came the next day and ended up with those awful “modern” rooms. Our bathroom had some damp but this didn’t bother us, it’s a tropical climate so we understand this is probably a common issue. Anyway, moving forward we received the room advertised and were disappointed again with the cheap furnishings within the outside area for the four rooms, this shared space for the four rooms was quite ugly, we expected a nice day bed or some lovely wooden style furnishings, but it was plastic cheap furniture. This really needs to be updated, you pay for a decent room for a reason! The resort itself is vast, lots of lounging areas but also crammed with mismatching furniture and tired looking furniture in much need of replacement. Please can this be looked into, especially when you are adding more rooms to the resort, at least get what you already have right first!Now moving onto the pools, there are six to choose from however the majority are what I would call plunge pools and the two main pools which you could really swim in were the cleanest and nicest of the pools but were unfortunately next to the construction whereby they are adding more rooms, this was not peaceful or relaxing for sunbathing, such a shame. We should be pre warned of construction, we would not have stayed here if we knew this beforehand! Please note, the pool by the restaurant definitely needs draining and maintenance, particularly re-grouting. Onto the Spa, very overpriced compared to amazing massages and treatments you can receive in the town and even just down the road! (Around five times the price!) We asked for a price list and were told to take photos of the prices shows at the spa desk with our phones; why they don’t have the prices in the room booklets is ridiculous! To be honest, we may have considered the massages and treatments if the hotel wasn’t so disappointing but as I said, you can get way more for your money elsewhere and there’s so many nice spas to choose from!Breakfast is between 7am and 10:30am, we’ve had far better variety and taste all over South East Asia particularly Bali, I am shocked how poor breakfast was, fruit tasteless, coffee weak, cold pizza (seriously, in a “four star” hotel?). The fried rice was barely ok and the vegetables were edible. I wouldn’t bother having breakfast here, it’s so not worth it! In addition, the room service food was terrible apart from the burger and the salads by the pool were again, awful. The hotel has so much potential, but needs de-cluttering. Seriously remove the awful canvas style prints dotted around the hotel gardens, they are tacky and make the place feel really cheap, some are even ripped. Some of the garden areas are lovely and the staff try their best to maintain the fallen leaves, but some areas are filled again with cheap furniture, it’s just not luxury as advertised. The whole place feels cluttered and mismatched, please have an interior designer come in and sort out this ugly mess! This hotel is trying to cater for everyone, which is difficult and hard to get right, it’s not enjoyable having kids running around whilst they are playing music such as “if you’re happy and you know it clap your hands” and diving into the main pools screaming, it’s just a shambles. The Wi-Fi for our room (47 Copperwood) was ok for browsing but Netflix wouldn’t work as the signal was too poor, strong Wi-Fi is a must in these modern times. Please improve this! The location isn’t great, (no views and not suitable to walk to the main town area) which we knew as we wanted to just spend our last week of our travels enjoying the resort and just a one day tour of Ubud, but as the hotel was so poor for us, we had to make use of the free shuttle to town often which became a pain and taxis aren’t cheap if you use them everyday, hence the free shuttle is highly recommended. If the hotel was up to the standard it should be, we wouldn’t need to leave the resort, such a shame!We only bought one half day tour through the hotel which was 500,000 rupiah for four hours, approx (£26) but we couldn’t complete visiting the three sites in this time so skipped the last temple otherwise there’s an overtime charge. (Please note, its only transport so you still have to pay entrance fees etc, which they do tell you beforehand). The only saving grace is we did like the room once we received what was advertised and despite housekeeping failing to refill the hand soap for a couple days, they were fairly thorough with the room cleaning. The staff overall are so lovely, they are nice people and none of the above is their fault. Poor management and maintenance is the clear issue for this hotel. We have stayed in two other three star hotels, one in Seminyak and another on Gili Trawangan and both were far superior to this hotel! We have tried to email the General Manager but three days and still no response. It’s with regret to say, we would never return to this hotel and it’s left a bitter taste for our last week in Bali. Absolutely disappointed.I will say Ubud is lovely, so we will return but we will definitely make sure to stay somewhere else!","April 7, 2019","5    The Mansion Bali

The hotel has their own transport facility to Ubud town/market so commute isn't an issue. Loved the traditional Balinese short dance shows on Thursday night and the young ladies attire in ethnic Balinese style were really enchanting. Only challenge could be to find food options outside of this hotel, but there's a Warung Made right on the main road 100 meters away outside the hotel which will give you nice local food. Hotel's breakfast was good too.One star less because despite many rooms empty, they initially gave me a room that was in the farthest corner and upper floor - did not appreciate that.

Demanded money back but was basically told no. Left the hotel - no refund and cut my trip short by 5 days and went back to UK. Avoid the hotel at all costs. Used toiletries were found from previous guests in the bathroom and rubbish was found on site.","November 30, 2018","5    The Mansion Bali

287,"We stayed in The Mansion Resort and Spa for 4 nights, and were really happy with the resort/hotel. It could use some TLC in parts, and they had started work in some areas of the hotel which was at times noisy but for the most part the hotel was clean, the service was great, and the hotel has a lovely peaceful and relaxing vibe.The breakfast selection had lots to choose from, and the one lunch and dinner we ate in the restaurant was of good quality.

288,"Amazing landscaping with a number of water bodies, gardens, sitting areas and nice interiors of the guest rooms, all done tastefully in Balinese style. It’s a huge property and you can spend almost a day exploring the various setups in the resort itself. There is a beautiful open area by the poolside and also a thatched roofed area nearby where you can enjoy your food. The guest rooms are well appointed with all the amenities. Given the appreciable distance guest rooms are located from the central building the service is a bit slow. The only downside is the food menu which I didn’t like and also the front desk which lacked professionalism and at times behaved rudely.","November 7, 2018","5    The Mansion Bali

289,"The resort is really cosy, quiet, tranquil and authentic Balinese. It felt like living in a genuine luxurious monastery hidden away in the rainforest. The only letdown was the restaurant. The food was not as good as you would expect from a resort at this level. So after trying to eat dinner there twice, we decided to go elsewhere in Ubud for dinner. Breakfast was also a letdown. No freshly pressed juices, bacon always finished, and the plates with the fresh fruits, salads and vegetables were filled with small fruit flies. And the plates with the sweet stuff were filled with small black ants. So bacon and eggs were the only thing you could eat, and the bacon was always finished, so eggs for breakfast was the only choice really. One good thing though was that the place was Chinese free. Almost every other hotel around Bali that me and my wife stayed at had loads of loud and ill-mannered Chinese people, who have no idea how to behave when they go to other countries and meet other people from other cultures. They spit and blow their noses in the pools, they are loud in restaurants to the point you no longer can enjoy a quiet romantic candle light dinner, their children run around screaming in the restaurants and resort premises without being told off by their parents and they leave their trash everywhere. Consideration to others seems to be completely unknown to Chinese people. So I would recommend and come back to this resort, just because there were no Chinese people staying at the resort.","November 3, 2018","5    The Mansion Bali

292,Had a really enjoyable stay at this lovely spa resort. Our room was of a very high standard and staff extremely helpful at all times. Breakfast by the pool was a great start to the day and the half board option was good choice as we didn’t need to take a taxi back to town in the evening. Taxi was cheap so no big deal if food hadn’t been available in the evening. Concierge was very knowledgeable about local area and helped us decide where to visit. Didn’t use the spa as it was expensive in comparison with places in Ubud where we had great Balinese massage. We used a hotel driver for a day trip and it was well priced. Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to others.,"October 7, 2018","5    The Mansion Bali

294,"We stayed at the Mansion for 7 days and throughoughy enjoyed our holiday. Our room was spacious and designed in a lovely Balinese theme which is totally what we were after.The free shuttle bus to the centre was convenient and prompt. Guest relations were friendly and explained to us the best sights to see. We had a fabulous all day tour white water rafting, seeing the temples and ate at some beautiful locations. Highly recommend talking with front of house for insights.There were many options for breakfast. Unfortunately it starts at 7am but we are super early risers so these times would be appropriate if not early for most people.We spent most of our time by the magnificent pool having lunch and cocktails. Truly a relaxing holiday. The grounds and the pools are just gorgeous. We tried all 5 of them. My favorite would have to be the main pool. Do yourself a favour and spend at least a day there with cocktails.Thank you team for a wonderful holiday.","September 28, 2018","5    The Mansion Bali

We had to change the first room as it was so humid (no ventilation in the bathroom, no bathroom door to separate toilets from the bedroom) and bedsheets showed dirty brown stains.The place in general looked cheap and poorly maintained: cracks, falling paints, broken furniture, random equipment laying around, dust and spider webs in the bar and breakfast area. From the room we could hear farm noises from nearby and also the staff's smoking area, with constant disturbances.Breakfast was below average, definitely not a 5*. Cheap industrial bread and pastries, disgusting coffee, tasteless ""local"" dishes.Staff was difficult to communicate with and lacked training.

298,"We choose The Mansion as the hotel has about 4 or 5 swimming pools. I'm not a good swimmer and not very confidence, that's why being in quiet pool is really importand to me and that's the best part.We stayed for one night on the 2nd floor. Upon arrival, we were greeted warmly by the lovely Reception, and checked in was quick. We were taken to our room, and a little tour on the way to our room. The room is adequate, lovely and spacious for 2 of us. An extra matrass/bed for the 2nd bed is available, to cater for family.Free shuttle service to and from Ubud is available, which is very handy as the hotel located out of the centre of Ubud. The Mansion has a stunning garden with ample of outdoor space. Perfect spot to spend the day around the hotel. The wifi is really annoying and there's no connection at all in our room, or even we've got the connection it's only one bar of signal and disconnected immediately.

302,"We stayed at the mansion for 5 nights and were extremely excited as the pictures on the website looked incredible. However when we arrived and shown to our room there is a lot of maintenance to be done and it is quite dated. There was no door to the bathroom, which wasn’t an issue, but there was no shower curtain so the bathroom was completely soaked every time. The TV picture was horrendous and the fridge didn’t work. The air conditioning, after being left on during the night eventually started spitting ice out. When it’s directly above your head in bed it’s not the best wake up call. The free shuttle bus is a bonus, but the last one is at 9pm which is a little early and there aren’t many taxis in town. Maybe 10pm would be better. When one night we chose to get a taxi back at 10pm, we wanted to have a drink in the restaurant when we got back, only to be told they were now closed. They reluctantly let us order one drink (as long as they weren’t cocktails) and sit outside, but they closed all the doors on us, switched off the lights and all staff left - leaving us feeling like we had been a bit naughty by wanting a drink past 10pm! Upon checkout we tried to pay for our room via our STA MasterCard for it to be declined despite there being sufficient funds. The lady behind reception was very rude and shouted “DECLINED” for all to hear which was quite embarrassing considering we did have enough money. The only good thing I can say about this hotel is that the housekeeping staff are incredible and kind. They will go above and beyond for you, however the restaurant, reception and bar staff - not so much. Always having to ask for more cutlery at breakfast despite there being plenty of staff. The food in the restaurant is ridiculously priced for what it is. It’s like they believe because they’re a 5 star hotel they can charge those prices, but in my opinion they’re more like a 3 star. We stayed at a 3 star in Seminyak prior to the Mansion and would go back there in a heartbeat compared to this. That was more like a 5 star. Word of advice: stay closer to the centre of Ubud at a different hotel.","September 8, 2018","5    The Mansion Bali

305,"Firstly, the place is an incredibly beautiful resort. 5 amazing pools. Stayed here at the last minute as an alternate arrangement to their brother hotel in the centre of Ubud which we had problems with, so my girlfriend and I arrived extremely late. The staff here were lovely and accomodating. This hotel is far from the centre of town which we had not planned for, so The Mansion organised one free shuttle to a location of our choosing once per day during the duration of our stay which was a lovely compromise considering we had not planned to stay there. Because we arrived late, and could not get to any restaurants for dinner, they also gave us 20% off our dinner and 20% off massages (although we didn't take their offer for a discount on their massage, it was still nice knowing we could if wanted to!). My only real complaint is that it is far away from the centre and also that there were a few small issues in the room. The room itself is a bit dated. The safe had a malfunction and kept setting off a break-in alarm. The door to the bathroom would not close properly- you had to slam the door for it to close, and there were a few kinks with the aircon which had to be fixed by maintenance, however these issues were all solved quickly and promptly. The water in the shower would not drain properly, half-flooding the shower area and the toilet sometimes would not flush well (although about the toilet and shower, we did not complain because the staff were so nice). By one of the pools, there were pool lounge seats with a retractable roof. One seat had no roof, only a metal frame, and the other had a roof that would not stay extended, collapsing back into the open position. Staff told us there were pool towels by the pool- there were none. Weak wi-fi reception in the room we stayed in (Arjuna), so you had to move around the suite to find the best wi-fi area which was a bit annoying. These issues however were definitely small issues, and not fatal to our staying at the hotel. All-in-all, a beautiful resort, and considering the great amenities, it was a great stay! Great staff. The above issues are all easy to fix and I'm sure they will be fixed.","August 30, 2018","5    The Mansion Bali

308,"Spent 3 nights here for our first hotel in Bali, had a lovely spacious room which was actually situated in the conference/meeting room which lead off to 5 rooms inside the building. The room was massive with a big circular bath in the corner. The hotel offers a shuttle to the centre of Ubud and picks you up as well, the reception can give you the times which I believe was every hour or two hours. Loved the scenery around the hotel, with the treehouse situated in the middle and has great photo opportunities everywhere you walked around. The hotel has loads of pools with the main one next to the pool bar which is reasonably priced for food and drinks. We hired out a private taxi through the reception and the lovely man took me and my girlfriend around the centre of Bali, which you can choose and he'll also give recommendations of places that you can go too within the hours that you have booked the taxi for. I have still got the number for the man which you can email or contact him on Whatsapp if anyone wants it, i would highly recommened as that was the best thing we did in Bali. Went to the restuarant at night twice and was dissapointed with the service from one of the staff there who served us both of nights. He took nearly 20 mins just to give us the drinks and food menu and then another 15 mins to come back to allow us to order, which he got both our orders wrong on both nights. There was only a couple of other guests and loads of staff, after our meal on the second night when we paid, he accused us off not paying and eventually apologised and said he forgot. However, that was the only negative thing about this great hotel. Would love to come back to this hotel and when we are next in Bali, we will not think twice about booking again.","August 17, 2018","5    The Mansion Bali

I ventured out that afternoon to check the place out and got lost in this huge resort.We decided to dine in 2 dinners and totally in love with the Grilled salmon and rice.

312,"We stayed here for 3 nights as part of our first location of our time in Bali. We were eager to get a traditional feel of Bali and this hotel gave it to us.Hotel grounds:The grounds are stunning, and when we arrived we were given a tour realising how much bigger this resort is than we’d thought. The pools were gorgeous and plenty of sun beds and seating areas to relax in. Room:We stayed in Bambu Wood which was pretty basic and although the room is quite worn and could do with some refreshing, it maintained a true Bali feel. A large four poster Balinese-style bed and an almost water feature-like shower. Restaurant:We only ate in the restaurant for dinner on the night we arrived and sat by the romantic lit pool. Yes it is typically more expensive than most Bali restaurants, but expected from a hotel. It was average food but I would recommend venturing out as there’s so many impressive eats. We had breakfast included which was fine, plenty of fresh fruits and bread and an egg station.Location: This hotel is a little out from Ubud centre but we found a fantastic walk through to Ubud one lunch time. Turning right out the hotel as far as Cafe Vespas (great for lunch), then continue straight down a narrow road, rather than continuing round to the right or taking the left down another gravelled road. Down here you’ll find loads of little cafes, a gorgeous shrine on the right hand side and as you continue you’ll find yourself almost in Ubud centre (near Bridges restaurant a bit further to the right along that main road). We also found Sayan House which is so romantic and only a 10/15 min walk from the hotel (see review).You can also catch the free shuttle down to Ubud and ask for taxis from the hotel to your destination. We went to Bridges (see review) for dinner and only paid about 80,000 IDR which is less than £5 and even less coming back from a local taxi. Excursions:We did Mount Batur trek with Tour Bali Driver (booked online through trip advisor) which was worth doing although extremely tiring and hard work! But a great experience. We also did a one day tour with Hire Bali Driver (trip advisor also) and selected the sights we wanted to see.Overall I think this was a great choice of hotel and would certainly recommend if you want something traditional and staying for a short time.

The staff are friendly (as you'd expect with the Balinese), the accommodation is well priced and they have a restaurant that met all our expectations. Please try the fresh fruit juices!The hotel also arranged a driver for us that literally made our first day fabulous! His name is Annga. His English is very good, and he just did everything to make our day special. Finishing off with sunset at Crystal Bay was the perfect ending.Only draw back at the Hotel was the hot water.

They arranged for someone to meet me at the boat dock to take me to the hotel and then brought me back to the dock when I was returning to Bali. They arranged 2 different tours for me, which were both amazing. I really liked the pool with it's wall that was a waterfall. The sound was very relaxing. They offered yoga twice a day with a woman named, Gizelle, who was quite a dynamic woman. She was super helpful in teaching me the proper techniques and poses. It was a class called sky flow yoga and I had never done this before. Great to have the option to do yoga right at the hotel. The staff was very helpful and I liked that breakfast was included.

341,"Came here because of the reviews and the price, it did not disappoint. We called the hotel and they gladly sent a car to pick us up. They were very enthusiastic and informative on the way over to the hotel, and when I asked if they had coconuts at the hotel, they told me we could stop at a place that sold them on the way there. Great!The rooms were clean, AC was good, fridge even had space for a coconut :DThe atmosphere at the hotel was nice and relaxing. They even had a little hut to do yoga in. Not too many rooms so it didn't get crowded. Pool was nice and clean, and the food at the restaurant was decent. The staff however, were very nice and always greeted you with a smile and went out of their way to accommodate you.The management at the hotel also helped us with getting a driver to go to the destinations/attractions we wanted to go to for a very good price. Our driver was Slom and he was a great guy and drove us safely and promptly to our destinations. He also did a good job as our guide at the destinations we went to. Some of the roads are in very rough shape so we were glad he was driving us. If I ever come back to this island, I know where I'll stay!

Located close to the harbor, but if you have more than a back pack you'll probably want to get a taxi. The restaurant has decent prices and I recommend the chicken club sandwich. The hotel rents scooters at a decent price, but if you need more than 70cc check the harbor.The pool was having issues when we first arrived. The water was murky with white floaties creating the murkiness. The next day the murkiness was gone so we swam. But the following day it was back. Not sure what was going on there.

343,"Overall we were pleased with our choice to stay here. We booked for 4 nights then extended the stay for an extra night at late notice and staff were very helpful, rebooking us into our existing room. Reception staff were great with helping us to organise excellent drivers for exploring the island and they offered good advice on the best way to see the places that we wanted to visit (from our pre-researched list).The location was a short walk to the beachfront via a laneway, with a store conveniently next door for buying water etc. All staff had a friendly, helpful attitude.The room was clean, aircon effective, WiFi reliable bed was huuuuge and comfortable with nice sheets & duvet. There was a good sized portable drying rack in the room - very handy for drying bathers and hand washing. The only room downsides were the lack of a luggage rack for bags and the bath towels and bath mats have truly seen better days - they were permanently discolored and stained - the worst we have ever encountered!The grounds are lovely and well maintained, although there was a problem with the pool when we arrived (due to heavy rainfall apparently) - the pool looked cloudy and univiting and it took several days of staff working to resolve the issues. The day we checked out it seemed like the issues had finally been resolved.The breakfast menu was pretty standard - nothing to complain about. The restaurant was pretty full every night from people staying at hotel plus people from surrounding accommodations.

360,"Me and my wife stayed stayed for 2 nights ( should of been 3 ) in the beginning of August .Nusa Penida is a very “raw” island without all the tourist infrastructure that people are used to, and this hotel is the best place to stay.The staff is fantastic , very kind , helpful and always trying to help .Unfortunately for us during our stay we had a big earthquake in Lombok , that gave everyone a bad time !But one fantastic thing was all the staff , the general manager ( sorry don’t remember the name ) manage to get everyone in vans , take us to the top of the hill , got us waters and manage to stay calm in a hard situation. All this because a tsunami warning was there.All staff did fantastic.It’s a clean space near the road , with some nice restaurants all around and very close to the harbor.I highly recommend staying time in this place if you visit this island .","August 9, 2018","6    Hotel Arsa Santhi Nusa Penida

363,"We had a very good stay at Arsa Santhi. The rooms are spacious and clean, the pool is great if you want to take a break from exploring Nusa Penida, and the staff is very friendly. Most of them are quite bad in English, though, but the blonde guy (think his name was ‘Madhi’) spoke it quite OK and helped us with everything! Breakfast is included (and quite tasty), and motor cycles are for rent at the hotel. You can also ask for guided tours, but I didn’t do these.On the downside, I do believe they are asking too much money for what you receive. Other stays on Nusa Penida (f.e. Nusa Penida Homestay) provide the same level of cleanliness and friendliness but are way cheaper! The only big difference is the pool, it’s up to you to decide if it’s worth the extra bucks.

370,"We had the privilege of staying almost 3 weeks at Alam Sari, and was taken by the beauty of the place and the friendliness of the staff. Our room was ideal for us, who like to fall asleep and wake up to the sounds of nature. There was some noise from traffic in the daytime, but on the other hand you have the privilege of wandering around in the beautiful garden, picking flowers and fruit, or take a stroll in the nearby rice-fields. Getting to know some of the people working here was of special value to us. Putu who became our guide, driver and friend, is a living encyclopedia of knowledge about most aspects of Balinese nature and culture, and showed us a warmth and generosity, that went far beyond our expectations. Kerti - serving with the grace of a Balinese legong-dancer, treated us with flowers and offerings and Warsi with her gentle smile proved to be a capable masseur in addition to her many other functions. And Agung, with his wonderful sense of humor, and Wayan and...In short everyone there had their share in making our stay both pleasant and enriching.

372,"We stayed 2 nights in this fantastic little place, nestled amidst the lush tropical greenery and a far cry from the crowds of the major resorts to the south of the island. After a very long journey, it was immediately refreshing to be welcomed so warmly and we felt our vacation had really begun as we sipped our cocktails by the lovely pool, surrounded by the exotic sights and sounds of the forest. The staff were excellent - friendly, helpful, efficient and always greeted us with a warm smile - and the fact that they are all local people made this feel like an establishment that is firmly connected to the community.We would particularly highlight Putu, their guide/driver and all-round local expert, who took us on a fascinating tour of the village, and the hotel's organic gardens where he pointed out all manner of exotic varieties that we had never seen growing - nutmeg, peppercorns, cocoa, passion fruit, cinnamon, etc. He knew exactly the perfect time to take us for a tour of the nearby water temple at Tirta Empul, so that we arrived just as the ceremonies were reaching their climax. This is the kind of personal touch and knowledge that elevates a great experience into a lifelong memory. Our room was very comfortable, a 2 bedroom traditional bungalow which was ideal for us and our two teens. Everything was spotlessly clean, well-equipped, with a rustic charm that really added to the sense of being in the authentic Bali. There were several families with young children, and you could see how the staff went out of their way to make them feel at home. We never heard any other guests in the evenings and overall the atmosphere felt quiet and private. For us, being surrounded by the flora and fauna of the forest was a real plus, and it never made us uncomfortable. The butterflies were so beautiful and the geckos were fun - much better than listening to the drone of a TV as you eat dinner!We found all our meals at the restaurant very good, with breakfasts offering nice combinations of western and Balinese/Indonesian favorites and dinners expanding further into local cuisine. Again, everything was well done, prepared and cooked in-house, from fresh, many spices and herbs coming from their own garden.Many activities are offered to further enhance the experience, such as cooking classes and yoga.We would highly recommend Alam Sari to anyone looking for a restful and immersive vacation experience in the real Bali and we cannot wait to return.","January 12, 2019","7    Alam Sari

374,"I stayed here with my partner over 5 days to experience the “real” Bali. However, I was incredibly disappointed. This place is really dirty and grimey. I wouldn’t recommend whatsoever. The bed linen is covered in mould and is torn/damaged. When I stay at a resort clean sheets is a must. The bed is nothing more than a foam mattress which is hard and makes for a bad nights rest.  The shower takes about 15 minutes of completely running for the water to be luke warm at best. No such thing as a hot function. The wifi signal is very poor. To the extent where internet pages cannot load. We’ve had to go into ubud to contact family. Additionally the free shuttles the resort provides are so unreliable. We were left waiting in ubud for an hour and had to pay for our own transport back. Totally not acceptable. The air conditioning is almost useless and we were constantly waking up hot.","December 27, 2018","7    Alam Sari

375,"We stayed after a recommendation from a friend but unfortunately our 1 night stay did not live up to expectation. Positives: the hotel is beautiful, lush vegetation is all across the property. The rooms have pretty 4 poster beds & are unique with a mini covered garden in the bathroom & the pool area is pretty & well maintained. Also the receptionist went out of her way to help with a plug to charge our mobile phones. Negatives: the village tour is only available if you stay 2 nights. The doors to the terrace on the room we were initially given didn't lock which was a security concern and when we asked reception, they already knew! They gave us a new room when we were clear we weren't happy. We ate dinner in restaurant, having been told the food was amazing...it was not. I ordered a tenderloin beef dish, the flavours were lovely but the beef was so tough that I couldn't eat it. My partner had a bland green chicken curry. And when we ordered the chocolate sundae what arrived was 3 small scoops of icecream, a trickle of chocolate sauce with 4 peanuts on top! Breakfast was similar, could only have tea or coffee, wouldn't allow me a juice unless I paid extra.The quality of the food was passable.

377,Off the beaten track but great location if you want to do the white water rafting or Elephant Sanctuary which they can organise for you. Very reasonable prices at £23 a night - its essentially a set of self contained bungalows or a large villa depending what you book and they picked us up from Ubud - the drive up is stunning!!. The highlight was the walking tour of the hotels organic gardens with Wayan who was just such in interesting guide - across the paddy fields and meeting the locals included the Keliki Art school.

It was really a magical experience for me and I put much of it down to the atmosphere of Bali that Alam Sari exudes. The staff and surrounds have a gentleness about them that immediately welcomes guests to relax. It seemed that a lot of thought had gone into the food and preparation and it certainly was appreciated by the guests with numerous dietary requirements.

The staff is welcoming from the moment they meet you at the airport to the moment they hug you good bye. They are loving, kind, caring, and well trained. When you arrive you realize that Alam Sari truly is the essence of Bali. It is a lush surrounding that immediately gives you the feeling ""I have arrived...ahhhhh!""It is perfect for an individual seeking solitude, a family wanting a safe and culturally rich environment to explore, a book club wanting time to read and chat while floating in the pool (especially nice during the Readers and Writers Conference in Ubud - check it out) or for those who want to learn more about Balinese culture while being pampered. Alam Sari offers unique side trips that only they can offer such as hikes through local villages or a day with Dewi in his family compound, cooking local foods in his home. Unbelievable. I still have to pinch myself to believe this trip was true. If you have one trip-of-a lifetime you want to take head to Alam Sari and tell them hello for me.","February 26, 2018","7    Alam Sari

There are many lovely places to stay in the UBUD area but if you are looking for a peaceful place to stay away from the hurly burly this one is right up there for me ( in its price bracket). The staff are all from the local village of Keliki and are , to a man and woman , wonderful. Kerti, Agung and Warsi the waiting staff can't do enough for you. Dewa and Putu who act as guides are philosophers and will enrich your stay. Don't go to Alam Sari if you want a 5 star 'plastic' experience.

388,"Stayed there for a night on my special day and my main expectation was the room view and surrounding - peaceful wet foggy tropical forests , however it turned out to "" didn't meet expectation"" at allPROS :Friendly staffA cake set up in the room was a nice gestureFresh water in the pool and bathroom Beautiful green jungle view and organic garden if you go up.The one hard pillow and one soft pillow is a nice combo!CONS :You would sense a moldy / humid smell in the room, on the sheets and fabrics but (I personally thought) it's tolerable due to its location in the middle of the forests. However they put this automatic room air freshener on the top of the wardrobe facing to the bed and it sprays chemical fragrance every 20 minutes! Definitely a no no during the night time.I would suggest to use more nature products that you can easily find anywhere in Bali like coffee ground or lemon grass. I believe it costs less as well.WIFI was very weak, and did not work at all during our stay. Shared my feedbacks to reception and she said that iPhone often had problem with it. I did not comment more after that.Local cellular signal was also weak due to its remote location, so for those who needs good internet connection needs to be very patient as both connections are unstable.No hand spray near the toilet bowl (it's important bathroom feature for Indonesian/ Southeast Asian)Very limited basic breakfast options : started with a tiny cup of coffee / tea and a piece of bread ( 4 pieces for 4 of us!) and you can only choose 1 menu from the list (western or local delight). We chose fried rice which stated that it came up with chicken and I have confirmed with the waiter but we got fried rice which had been cooked in advance (the rice was not even warm when it served in our table) and it has no chicken at all - not even the shredded ones mixed with the rice. We did not report about the chicken to the waiter, and we also needed to ask for shrimp crackers (which was a major condiment for nasi goreng Indonesia and they should put it together already). Sambal sauce was not served unless you ask for it.Slices of tropical fruits included as part of breakfast would be really nice considering they have their own organic garden but nothing was given as it's one of the breakfast menu (served with yoghurt) and you could not choose others if you choose the fruits one.Bali is a tropical fruit paradise, meaning it's not cost a lot (or maybe you can grow them on your own garden) and they should have it as breakfast pass around.Drinking water was also will not be served unless you ask the waiter for it.Traffic noise was also an issue, we could hear it from the pool, the restaurant, the lobby as the main road was just down the cliff.Laying down on a sun chairs in the pool : pleasure to the eyes, no pleasure to the ears.Our main issue was the room, we booked a Deluxe Family Room which stated on their website to have a look out view over the swimming pool and coconut groves, with a really nice pictures with the green view, swimming pool, and a long chair on the balcony/ terrace however we are quite shocked to find out that the room we're given was facing to the walls and the restaurant / lobby rooftop with no view at all. no long chair on our terrace and we could hear people chattering behind the wall. I shared my feedbacks directly with the reception, told her that this was not as seen as in the pictures on the website, she kept saying that what explained on the website was a Deluxe room and not a family room, and she apologized that she could not move us to any other room because they were fully booked. (later I checked the room availability online (Agoda App) and saw they still have one Suite available on the same night, maybe it was an error from the online website or maybe The Suite indeed available but it was way more expensive than what we paid for so there was no chance to move us to that room). I did not tell the Reception about that as simply I did not want to be pushy on my special day.The lady who checked us in offered to compensate our inconvenience with a massage treatment for 1 person ( which I thanked her) but I had to reject it because that would be unfair for my other 3 friends.TIPS :If you're looking for a room with a nice view , stay away from Bouganville 1 & 2 !Pictures showed online could be really different with reality.This hotel is not suitable for elderly as you need to pass lots of steep stairs (could be slippery on rainy days) before you can reach lobby and some rooms.Be prepared to see some insects in the bathroom as it is semi open air with plantation inside and due its location in the mid of forests (pretty common in Ubud hotels )We had a chance to go up and see some other rooms and organic garden, indeed they have some nice rooms with jungle view. If you want to stay here, you better call them in advance and ensure you won't get the wall view.If you are sensitive with noises, this hotel might not for you unless you have room on the upper hill (not sure about the room type), but you will definitely hear it if you are in the pool chairs and restaurants during breakfast.Live Rindik instrument played was wonderful but breakfast experience could've been better if they are willing to pay some attention to the little things which matters like condiments, drinking water, some pass around like fruits or introduced some local ""japan pasar"" to their guests.","July 30, 2017","7    Alam Sari

390,"I stayed around Alam Sari for 10 days on a yoga retreat and I am have many good things to say! The staff were all so lovely and happy to help us! I always left my room in a big mess and would come home to all my things arranged neatly and organised very nicely The food is yummy! They have tempura veggies, nasi goreng, spinach pasta and lots more! The coconut ice cream they use for dessert is addictive! And the coconut porridge is delicious. Everything tastes very fresh and they have many healthy options using things from the garden. The cooking class offered is an amazing experience, it was one of the highlights of my trip. You get to see the local village and learn about the culture and spiritual practices and also learn to make delicious food and eat it too! The village tour is also a nice way to explore and learn more, Putu allowed us to go where we want and also waited a very long time for us to stop for shopping, and was still smiling : ) the art school is beautiful The facilities are nice, there is a pool, as well as a smaller plunge type pool near the ganesha villa that used to be the spa/jacuzzi but no longer works. There is also a meditation room which has yoga mats and props! The spa is small but also nice :) ","June 22, 2017","7    Alam Sari

391,"Our small family very much enjoyed our 3 nights at Alam Sari in June 2017. We booked on the recommendation of friends who had stayed there some years ago and were not disappointed. The resort is committed to eco-friendly practices (incuding limiting the use of plastics), employing local people from the nearby village of Keliki, and supporting cultural maintenance activities in the Keliki. The rooms are large and well appointed, Balinese-style, with air-con and private bathroom (our family room, Mangga, had 2 rooms and 2 bathrooms with a shower and toilet each). The staff were wonderful - super-welcoming and nothing was too much trouble. The pool is as good as the pictures look and we spent a lot of time in and around it. The restaurant was open all day and the food delicious and varied enough for all our tastes - some Balinese, Indonesian and more western as well - sometimes we ordered food by the pool, and in the evening we chose to eat at the resort rather than race around busy Ubud. There is a free shuttle into Ubud 3 times a day (9, 12, 5). We went to a dance show one night and arranged for Putu to collect us afterwards (100,000 IRP) - he was ready with a smile when we emerged and we had a late simple supper back at the resort when we returned. The absolute highlights of our stay at Alam Sari were the cultural elements: Putu guided us through the resort's garden and Keliki village the first morning we were there and this gave us a much greater understanding of the Balinese way of life. The tour included a stop at the Keliki painting school - a place for the village painting 'masters' to pass on their cultural traditions. There is no pressure to buy, but if you do, 80-90% of your purchase price is returned to the individual artist - many of them children and young people which helps them financially with their education. The second morning Dewa picked us up for a cooking class - first we walked around some more parts of the village, this time learning about the food production as well as some Balinese philosophies. We arrived at his family compound and had a cooking class where we learned how to cook 5 different dishes - all delicious! Our daughter (10) was captivated for the entire time too! We also learned a little more about family and village life which has been going on in similar style for over 800 years. The only negative for our stay was the noisy road below our family room: much (friendly) beeping to the spirits as bikes cross the ravine, and some very loud motorbike engines at times. There are 2 other family rooms and other rooms and villas which are not so noisy, but without the spectacular view to Mt Agung in the morning and/or proximity to the pool. If you contact the resort you can discuss your needs and preferences. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff at Alam Sari. We intend to return - having the opportunity to be shown aspects of the Balinese culture in such a welcoming environment is very special.","June 19, 2017","7    Alam Sari

We immediately felt welcome and we were treated like family from the moment we walked in. The resort is surrounded by nature and the grounding feeling of the earth, the trees and the plants is simply indescribable. Aprile has a deep and intense desire to keep the Balinese culture within the resort, to inform people of the beauty, the compassion, the purity, the love and the trust behind their gestures, their belief and their complete gratitude.","May 25, 2017","7    Alam Sari

393,"We stayed for 1 week at Alam Sari, but we could have stayed for a month. I booked it because of the reviews about the service and it didn't disappoint. Every staff member was so helpful and accommodating and went above and beyond. We had one of their family rooms- it's like 2 adjoining suites, which was absolutely perfect for our family of 4 (with our 2 young ones, ages 3 & 1). The pool is great for the kiddos too because there are essentially 3 tiers of depths! They had a yoga room as well that I was able to use with the kids to do some yoga throughout the week. Use their drivers as well - they are all superb & very good - even from the airport, which was great! And take advantage of the free Village Tour they offer - we thought it was such a wonderful added bonus- seeing their organic garden and tasting a few of the fruits, walking through the rice paddies, etc. Not stroller friendly, but we had a baby carrier and it was perfect! And the spa was wonderful too - I got a massage and scrub & soak and it was worth every penny. The only downfall was that the internet was a little slow and spotty. But we found this to be the case all over Bali unless you go to one of the internet cafe/working spots. A little unfortunate that the internet can't be more reliable, but we got enough work done to get us through the week.  Oh and in the Keliki Village, there is a great Thai restaurant worth checking out too.  Ah....can't say enough good things about this place. We've been traveling all over and my daughter still says this is her favorite place to stay!","May 16, 2017","7    Alam Sari

394,"My husband and I and our two year old daughter had such a beautiful time here. The staff was incredibly accommodating and friendly. They became close to my daughter during our stay and we were all sad when it was time to leave our new friends and this peaceful sanctuary. The food was some of the best we had in Bali so we ended up eating most of our meals at the hotel. We were able to schedule a cooking class with Dewa while we were there and that was a highlight of our trip. We were invited into his home in a local village and we learned so much about the Balinese culture, belief systems, their food and just every day life. For us that is the type of experience that we search for when we travel, to be immersed in the culture. We also enjoyed a visit to the Elephant Park and the monkey forest during our stay. They are both close by and they were a huge hit with my daughter who loves animals! It was such a great experience! I highly recommend Alam Sari!! ","May 16, 2017","7    Alam Sari

395,The property was disappointing to say the least. Mosquitos were a major concern and the uncleanliness of the restaurant and kitchen lead us to check out of the hotel a day earlier. Even the room toilets need major improvements. Overall the property was not even close to being as nice as what the photos suggested. The location of the hotel is quite far from the Ubud town which makes the area very quiet which some of you may like or dislike.

396,"Booked a suite room over a month ago.. pictures showed room with an outdoor terrace and seating overlooking the landscape. When I arrived I was taken to my room to find out it was a completely different room right in the back corner of the hotel.. With no view and no terrace just a small walkway.. I was told one of the doors could not be opened as it led to managers area. There was a lounge next to the room but I was told that I could not use it. After checking the pictures I complained that this was not the room I booked and I wanted a room with an outdoor terrace as I had booked. I was then told the room I had booked was under refurbishement ! I had a look around and I said I would swap for a room by the pool. 2 of them were also under refurbishement, the other 2 empty but he said guests would be arriving to take them. The only other room offered was a small side room with no view again! I asked for a refund..which I was given. I wasted taxi money coming all the way there to find out many of the rooms are under refurbishement including the one u had booked. This is terrible service as I booked a month earlier they should have contacted me to let me know that the room wasn't available letting me decide if I still wanted to come before wasting time and money to get to the isolated location. I then asked to be taken back to ubud.. I had to wait a further 3 hours for the free shuttle bus as they wouldn't organise a taxi for me unless I paid $30.

What a beautiful place along with the most lovely staff My friends and I enjoyed a very tranquil stay here, taking full use of the messages, pool area and lovely food. One of my favourite nights was going to a cooking class (arranged by Alam Sari) where we were lucky enough to go to the wonderful Dewa and Jeri's home in the village nearby. We had the most amazing food, as well as an incredible experience. They fully welcomed us into their home and I was in my element cooking delicious food! That was possibly my favourite night of the whole holiday to Bali.A staff member (arranged with Alam Sari) took us to the traditional local village, where the locals were busy preparing for a mass cremation ceremony. We also went around the grounds of the hotel to see all the organic food and herbs they grow. I would definitely go in the electric bike tour they arrange too, absolutely amazing riding through the rice paddies!I really enjoyed my stay here.

398,"It is located 20-25 minutes drive from Ubud Palace, on the slope of the Kelusa village, Ubud. To reach to the lobby will need to climb up by the stairs. The staffs received us really well, the nature surrounds are beautifully arranged with green tall plants. But I wouldn't say it is a quiet area as it is near the main road.The breakfast in the morning is always something that our family look forward, unfortunately the variety and quality of the dishes need more improvement. The omelette can be cooked in a few different ways with some vegetables etc, not only sunny side up or fried. However, our 2 kids had a lot of fun spending the day in the Swimming pool. We also had some massages in the Spa, the staffs treated us respectfully. But we've noticed that the music is too loud to our liking, the way the massage is ended is too abrupt for us....maybe if we are allowed to relax and drink traditional hot jamu/ginger should be better. In one evening dinner, we ordered the dishes prepared by the Chef. I happened to order Tenderloin beef which they also going to feature on New Year Dinner with the guests. I was shocked that the beef is barely edible even it is cooked. It is hard to chew, cut and swallowed. The side dishes which contained the vegetables are good.The walk around the village and organic garden are good. The staff was kind and sharing the culture and beliefs of Balinese. We also would like to point out that the shampoo and conditioner containers which made of out ceramic may not be ideal. It slipped into the slippery fingers of our boy and it is broken to pieces in the bathroom.Overall, our stay was good, the staffs are friendly and willing to help but hopefully there are improvement on the equipments and facilities also the quality of works of the staffs.","January 1, 2017","7    Alam Sari

Unfortunately the traffic from the main road down below can be a little bit disturbing, however not at night time which is great. The nights were quiet and enjoyable and I therefore had a good nights sleep every day. During the day we were not there as we wanted to see things. The pool is fantastic and there were plenty of opportunities to enjoy the surrounds in a comfortable deck chair. Absolutely lovely!. The ford was extraordinary no complaints whatsoever. Breakfast mmmmh. Dinner? No words to describe. Lunch? Were not there, better things to do. Service. Fantastic, friendly and spot on. Room service could use a bit of improvement as bottles, cups and other things from the previous day were not collected. Rooms: Lovely rooms, clean and no problems with mozzies. The toilet and shower area needs updating as due to consistent moisture as it is in the tropics cement deteriorates and falls out of grooves. There is definitely room for improvement and these areas need renovation to some extent. Staff very friendly and nothing is ever to much always with a smile and no complaints. Overall we had a wonderful experience. If however the areas mentioned are improved the experience deserves certainly an excellent.

The property is gorgeous and the rooms well-appointed, the food served is good (albeit lacking some heat/flavour - we feel they tone it down for Westerners), and the spa treatments excellent (go for the exfoliating massage with floral bath afterwards - HEAVEN).

411,"Where do I even start, I needed a solo trip to find myself and I chose Alam Sari after days of searching for a hotel. I got there late at night and was escorted to one of the most beautiful rooms I've ever been in and it was all mine. Alam Sari is the ideal hotel for solo travelers wanting to find themselves, families vacationing and couples relaxing. It is beyond perfect. I woke up in the morning to a beautiful landscape, delicious breakfast and an eager staff that was ready to show me the time of my life. Ketut was such a doll, let me tell you, words cannot describe how much I appreciate her. I pretty much told her my wishes and she rubbed her imaginary bottle and my wishes instantly came true. She scheduled all my trips to Tanah Lot, Uluwatu, Kintemani, Dreambeach, Gili Air and many more, all sights I encourage you to ask her to set up for you. My amazing driver Putu was fabulous, he was diligent and taught me so much about the culture while driving me from temple to temple. He has the best music, ask him to play some while you're driving around with him, you'll love it. I did the village tour and I must say, you HAVE to do it. It was so great getting to see the rice paddies, the beautiful village, the amazing painting school while strolling around Ubud and taking in the beautiful surroundings, that definitely beat the hustle and bustle that is downtown SF where I live. But the super highlight of my entire trip was the cooking class, if you don't do anything your entire time at Alam Sari, please take the cooking class and prepare to be engulfed by the amazing history of the Balinese culture when it comes to food preparation and the delicious food that you will eat and learn how to cook when it's all said and done. You just have to do this on your own and I promise you it'll be worthwhile. So from the beautiful hotel, to the warm staff, to the amazing and delicious food, all I have are sweet memories and I can only so much encourage you to try it for yourself. Thank you so much to the Alam Sari team for giving me the solo vacation of a lifetime to help me forget the troubles that exist in my world. So much love and appreciation. See you again soon!

We did a tour of the local village which starts off at the Hotel’s own organic garden (where much of the food they serve is sourced), we learned about the local village culture and lifestyle, then on to the local art school where we met with the resident master Keliki painter.

417,"Alam Sari made my first visit to Indonesia a truly special experience. The staff were beyond kind- and extremely helpful whenever we needed anything. The grounds are beautiful and peaceful, and our room spacious, clean and real comfy. This place is a beautiful tropical oasis w a genuine personal touch :) I'll definitely stay here again if I'm ever lucky enough to return! *Make sure to do the Village tour/cooking class- it's amazing!

418,"My group of 10 friends and I chose the Alam Sari because it was one of the few properties adjacent to Ubud that had Villa living and awesome reviews. Needless to say, from the second our driver picked us up from the airport, and dropped us off at the Alam Sari, we knew we had made the right choice! Firstly, the staff is top notch. This is a family owned hotel in which the family is hands on. We were doted on like kings and queens. Breakfast was included daily and we had our limitless pick of fresh fruit, omelets, and a number of Balinese dishes. EVERYTHING was delicious. While my friends and I chose to venture into Ubud most nights for dinner, we did enjoy one group meal at the Alam Sari. The hotel accommodated our large group with ease. The food options were diverse, and everyone was incredibly satisfied. I particularly loved the beef randang! The Villa accommodations were spacious, elegant, pristine and romantic. We even had a yoga room at our disposal and a lounge area with comfy couches and a beverage stocked kitchen half the size of a football field it seemed. Our group of ten had enough room to play games, workout, lounge, etc... We were in heaven. The pool was similar to a lagoon--it was the perfect temperature and had pool side service. We all enjoyed swims at various times of the day. The massage treatments had to be booked several hours in advance and were also top notch. Several of us had couples massages and were left feeling relaxed and rejuvenated for a marginal fee. The highlight of our trip had to be the hotel orchestrated cultural walking tour and authentic cooking class. Our guide walked us through the hotel's organic gardens where the majority of the hotel's food comes from. Once our group saw this, we understood why the food tasted so good and was so fresh! We learned an endless amount of information about how the island came to be what it is today and the culture and the belief system of the people. Most importantly, we were invited to partake in an authentic cooking class in a Balinese home. The meal was literally mind blowing, and was hands down my favorite meal in Bali! It beat out every fancy restaurant without a doubt! In short, I am thrilled that we placed our bets on the Alam Sari. It was an adorable hotel adjacent to Ubud, but private and peaceful. It was exactly what we all needed! ;)","April 7, 2016","7    Alam Sari

419,This place demonstrates the process of how to make Luwak coffee. We were giving a tour then provided with a tasting plate of different teas and coffees to sample.

420,"Alam Sari was the perfect place to experience a traditional Bali. We loved being a short distance out of Ubud in a village. The setting is beautiful with interesting furnishings, excellent service and a relaxing atmosphere. We stayed 2 nights and had a midnight flight on the 3rd day. They let us check out late (7 p.m.) for 1/2 price. We ate our dinners in the restaurant and enjoyed the good food without having to hassle with going out. The breakfasts were generous and delicious. The Wi-Fi worked well if you sat in the reception area. The village tour was a highlight of our trip!","March 7, 2016","7    Alam Sari

We met their families, went and visited with a local artist at his home, had the best drivers. Happy and a great sense of humor. Cok the manager and his staff went out of their way to make sure everything was perfect. The rooms were comfortable and very clean. We had air. A beautiful room for a yoga studio. The food was excellent, and all from their organic garden. A great pool as well. They have it all. When in Ubud next, I will stay here again.

Very friendly staff and the local guide (unfortunately i´ve forgot his name) was very helpful.

423,"We (a group of 2 parents, 2 teenage daughters and one teenage friend) celebrated Christmas Day at the beautiful Alam Sari, nestled amongst the cool hills and in full view of Bali's sacred mountain, Gunung Agung.Alam Sari is a pleasant drive away from the often crowded Bali south coast, through towns and villages and farming land, and is located a little north of the bustling centre of Ubud.The location is perfect if you want a quiet, peaceful retreat from the beaches, crowds and heat of the coast, but is a comfortable distance (driving . . . or being driven) from some of the more interesting attractions and cultural experiences on offer in Bali. There are no nearby convenience stores, no nearby night-clubs, and definitely no nearby beach-going hawkers selling their wares, but there is a quiet walk through rice fields and the nearby village on offer from Alam Sari staff (no charge), and very close by is a bustling village night-market for those who savour the local food on offer.Rooms and villas on offer are beautifully presented, air-conditioned and with large mosquito nets gracing all beds. Staff are unobtrusive but friendly and welcoming, there is a restaurant in the grounds, and the pool water is actually cool, not warm.Recommended for getting away from it all, waking to the call of roosters nearby, and if you're lucky, early-morning views of Gunung Agung.","January 7, 2016","7    Alam Sari

424,"Upon arrival at the airport, our driver from Grand Zuri Kuta was already waiting for us at the arrival gate. He was very helpful and patient as we got our SIM cards settled and friendly on the drive to the airport. When we got to the hotel, Lilik and Dian the receptionists were again very helpful with our questions and gave a friendly welcome. Our room was tidied and cleaned everyday. With them providing two bottles of new water bottles with each clean. The balcony was a great place to relax and have a drink and chat as well. However the walls are abit thin, and if you get loud neighbors down the corridor who leave their door open and talk at the top of their lungs at 6am in the morning, YOU WILL HEAR THEM. But all in all, that’s not the hotel’s fault but lack of common decency from the other guests. Thanks Grand Zuri, we’ll definitely be back again!","July 10, 2019","8    Grand Zuri Kuta Bali

478,"Again, I highly recommend this hostel for budget travelers, and the location is perfect. It's near to almost everything. Seafood restaurants, Bar, beach, Art Market, Burger King, Mcdonald's, it's just around the corner. They allow you early check-in if the bed is available, they also offer free breakfast though it's limited to toasts and fruits and a cup of Balinese Coffee.We stayed in the Female Dorm, the beds were spacious! There are tiny compartments inside your ""bedroom"" and they got international sockets and usb sockets for your chargers so no need to worry about sockets! They also got a large locker, it fits my hand carry luggage. They got blind curtains as well so when you sleep you got privacy. The toilet and bath are in the same room in the floor, they got bidet! The soap and shampoos are in dispensers, too bad though they don't offer sleepers or toothbrush/toothpaste in their common CR. The hostel got rooftop! It was so nice to stay there at night! I think I love everything in the hostel EXCEPT THAT, this is the only downside for me, they don't have hot water in their showers. We wake up 3am everyday and we have to shower in the cold! We did not mind it that much since the weather is warm, but just imagine if it's cold and you have to shower with cold water as well!","July 8, 2019","9    H-ostel

Absolutely ridiculous.The breakfast was very average, and the toilets/showers smelt really weird. Like bleach plus whatever smell the bleach was trying to cover up. It also didn’t feel very clean in the bathroom. Also despite there being 3 floors of dorms (with around 20 beds in each), there were only 5 toilets for women. The men had double the number of toilets. Go figure.Overpriced and waste of money.Staff were nice though ","June 25, 2019","9    H-ostel

Upon check-in, you will be provided with a towel and coupons for free breakfast which was okay (not something you will be excited to wake up to though) but the rooftop atmosphere was really nice :) My only complaint would be encountering male workers, who were cleaning or fixing the sink, in the female only shower/bathroom even when guests are taking a shower or using the bathroom.

485,"If you are used to staying in Hostels, you know what to expect. If you are a first timer, you may not be disappointed. The place is centrally located, just at the cross roads of tourist area, very near to beach as well just a few minutes walk. That was about location. Now the living part. The dorms are well air conditioned. Though these are capsule beds, the air conditioning is effective till the end of the capsule. Bathrooms are regularly cleaned, some compartment doors in bathroom area need the PVC beading to be installed as in its absence one can see inside from the gap. Towels are fresh. Though the breakfast is quite in name only, still something is better than nothing in this price. But you can always order what you like. The rooftop breakfast area has a good view. Plus point is you get drinking water all the time from dispenser placed at roof top. The resteraunt staff is very cooperative and nice. The front office girls are also courteous and helpful. The bed sheets are also clean, you have a nice folding table also inside your capsule with universal plug point ( a big plus). You can rent scooter from here at reasonable rates. If you are trying out such accommodation for the firs time, you will be in for a nice experience. Deducted one point for the absence of door beading in bathrooms ( an essential thing) , which I hope will be installed shortly by the management . Wi-fi is also great. So, all points for location, price, cleanliness and friendly staff. ","April 4, 2019","9    H-ostel

A majority of their toiletts, showers, taps are malfunctioning and under maintenance all the time.And since you live in rooms of 22 it’s Alot more comfortable If atleast half the stuff works... next up there was the Food. We ordered a carbonara for 50k rupiahs. We got Literally 4 forks of Food. There was Almost Nothing on the plate, ridicoulose. What pissed us of even more was that we ordered a carbonara the day before and then we got about twice as much (which still was a small portion) we mentioned this to her when She served the Food since it Shocked us. She mumbled in a unhelpful manner that She Would look into it. She ends up not even Coming back with a compensation or even a response. Just totally ignored us. We go to her and make the contact. That’s first when She offers us to pay for 2 instead of 3. But really we got the Food of 1 so the compensation was just poor.Beds and location was the only positive things. Really dissapointed with the overall experience unfortunately. But some places are worse then others. PS.

My 3 star review comes from the customer service I received when booked a transfer pick up from the airport. I contacted them via email to organise this and confirmed all flight details. When I arrived at the airport I could not find anyone waiting for me so I called them and they said the service wasn’t available. I explained I had already had it confirmed. They were not helpful in any way. I then had to organise a car on the spot which cost me twice as much. When I got to the hostel there was no satisfactory apology for what had happened. I was very disappointed with being treated this way. I also emailed them to express this and still have not been contacted back. Like I said the hostel itself was pretty good but I would trust them to book another transfer. ,"December 4, 2018","9    H-ostel

The capsule style bed are clean and comfortable. The capsule space is well thought out, each bed has 2 universal outlets, and small drawers at the head and foot of the bed. There is also a space for your footwear and a personal secure locker (automatic lock) beside the beds.There were always plenty of clean washrooms and showers available with all of the necessary amenities (tissue, body wash, shampoo). A modest breakfast (toast, jams, coffee, tea) is included with each day's booking, served on the rooftop common-area. A food and drinks menu with more options is also available at a cost.The staff were always kind and helpful. A couple of the staff were particularly engaging and went above and beyond with helpful tips and recommendations.They are currently expanding the ground floor common-area to include a cafe/bar (I think). It is always good to see money being put back into the hostel to improve and upgrade the facilities.Overall 10/10 stay, I highly recommend staying here.","March 29, 2018","9    H-ostel

522,"H-ostel is the perfect backpacker choice if you like the crowd, Kuta and Legian is what we mean is not it? This place is located behind the Polo which is on the street of Kuta Art Market, it will be a little tricky when you first stay here. The first impression of entering the lobby at night, (around 7) is quite OK, looks very quiet, there are only 2 female receptionists who in my opinion need to improve the hospitality. I just hope they smile and ask me, but that is OK (in the lobby of the hostel they sell mineral water and beer).I got a room on the 1st floor, bed 110. When I entered the room I just realized why the lobby is quiet, people prefer to be in the room and chatting after bathing because they will soon party at this weekend. Some guests greet friendly, yes most of them are foreign tourists. Oh yes, all the rooms in this place are mixed male female. Wall plug in this place is compatible with different kind of plug type. Moreover, it also provides a USB plug with an output power of 2 Ampere!. The mattresses and blankets are padded and comfortable. The only thing that I feel can be improved is free slipper to be used in the hall, people come and goes with dirty and sandy feed living the hall floor feels dirty and gritty. The bathrooms is very good and everything that should be there is well looked after (soap, shampoo, hand soap). So, you just need to bring a dental kit. Hair dryer and zoomed Mirror are also provided. The water current is very good. However, the shower floor part is a bit slippery. The next day, I got up a little earlier, I decided to take a shower and enjoy breakfast in the lobby of the hostel. There are 3 choices of drinks provided, tea, coffee and black coffee. For food, the hostel will provide 2 slices of bread (which can be roasted or eaten directly). The choice of bread contents is assorted (butter, chocolate, blueberry, etc). Then I decided to go to rooftop hostel to see the ""bar"" there. Unfortunately, when I visited this bar is under renovation. Location wise, this place is excellent. You can see the street of Kartika Plaza and Kuta Beach from this place. For those of you who want to see the sunset but are a bit lazy to walk to other places, this rooftop is an OK place.

I was woken up several times through the night.Staff - always smiling and helpful with questions but indifferent. Bathroom - so clean!! The staff are obviously on a rota with cleaning the bathroom. I was very impressed - and I have high standards. Showers have hot water and good pressure. Maybe wear flip flops.General - didn't think much of the communal area, in fact the only time I sat there I got mosquito bites.

526,"PROS: A short walking distance to Kuta beach, Beach Walk Shopping Center, restaurants and shops, cheap, in a busy/central area so it is safe, and easy to meet new people. CONS: - VERY LOUD! (I was on the ground floor so can't speak for the other 4 levels.) There is NO sound proofing. The front desk is right by the door and is always blasting music. Which is okay, but they should sound proof the door! The small common room is also on the ground floor and people were up until 3am at times. Remember, NO sound proofing on ground floor! Bring ear plugs! - Shared bathroom on first floor only. For boys and girls (No separate stalls for genders) and decently clean for Bali hostel standards. In the shower stalls there weren't hooks to hang/store any of your items. Don't expect hotel cleanliness!- No extra space to store larger luggage. You get a small automatic key locker, but no way it can fit a backpackers bag or standard carryon bag. People's bags are all on the floor or in corners in the room. Recommend bringing a small lock for your luggage. - Lastly, I don't know if this happens often, but the middle of the second day I was there, the water stopped WORKING for the ENTIRE BUILDING ! They said it should get fixed by that evening.. but even late into the evening.. NO water anywhere. It was disgusting. I had to use the toilet middle of night in unflushed toilets . In the morning, STILL no water. I was very irritated and booked for a different hotel right away. We only got 50% of that night only and nothing back if we had booked for future nights. - I booked this hostel bc of the good reviews, but now I'm really questioning all of the good reviews!

550,We stayed 4 nights in H-Ostel and we were fairly disappointed due to one main thing: The room in the 5th floor with the double beds smelled like sewage or like someone vomited. It was not coming from the bed (this was fresh) which is good but it was still there 24/7. They tried to battle it with strong ventilators and room odors but it did not help much. We complained three times but it never changed significantly. The other floors of the hostel did not have the problem but they did not have double beds. Staff was generally friendly but not overly helpful. Breakfast is minimalistic ( two slices of bread + jam&co + tea/coffee). Design is cool though. all together I would not recommend to stay there despite all the other positive reviews. Considering other accommodation prices this is expensive for a hostel and does not meet the standards. Maybe due to the proximity to the airport a lot of people think that this is a cheap price and they can't expect more but this is not true. there are better places. ,"May 17, 2017","9    H-ostel

551,"I'm a solo traveler at the end of my budget and decided on h-Ostel for its central location warm atmosphere and great staff. It's located close to shopping, beaches, upscale and local restaurants. Very comfortable mattress and down filled duvet, the showers and toilets are kept spotless and the staff are beyond out going. They offer a free breakfast of toast and tea or coffee. All the workers were warm and welcoming but wilna especially stood out to me, taking interest in my daily activities and helping with whatever he could. ","May 11, 2017","9    H-ostel

Good service and resolution to the problem. Lockers were very secure, However the little beeping they make every time they are opened can be very disruptive to sleep at night. Breakfast was basic, toast and assorted spreads, with coffee. Location was great for exploring the touristic areas and beach.

553,"We stayed here for two nights while we were in Kuta. It's centrally located, close to all the restaurants and shopping areas. It's walking distance from the beach. All the hostels are capsule style. Overall, the capsules are fairly spacious and very well built. Each capsule comes with a hanger to hang your clothes, a little desk, and storage areas on side of the bed. It's evident that each capsule was designed to be your own small room. Each capsule is assigned to a locker. I had the top capsule as well as the top locker. It was too high for me, and can be annoying to get to. Overall, there're a LOT of capsules in one room, so it can get a bit crowded. One complaint is that the bathrooms can be pretty humid and damp. This is likely because most of us hit the beach and wash our swimming suit and leave our wet swimmimg suit in the bathroom. it'd be nice if the hostel can arrange some place to hang our clothes in the rooftop. Also, there isn't much of a common area as well. Overall, good location. Well thought out capsule. Would recommend it.","May 4, 2017","9    H-ostel

555,"PROs: Nice ""room"" - the bed is big enough (I imagine capsule hotels in Japan are smaller), comfortable bed, big lockers, acceptable breakfast. They have hairdryer, thank god! CONs: I hope there are more hooks in the shower area where you can hang clothes on. Also, no space to put your toiletries while you take a shower, you have to put them on the floor. A small counter will make a huge difference. Lastly, it would be nice if the people at the front desk can recommend tour providers. I asked them and one of the girls simply said ""I don't know."" I know it's not their job, but that extra effort to help and provide assistance to their guests (aside from just the lodging) will be very appreciated, I assure you. Overall, it was a good stay, the only bad thing was my noisy roommates who talked so loudly when they came in at 1 am from Sky Garden, but that wasn't H-ostel's fault. ","May 1, 2017","9    H-ostel

556,"Located in the heart of Kuta, the location is ideal for easy walking to all the local activities (beach, shopping, eating, nightlife). - My stay was only for transit purposes to Gili the next morning and the accommodations were really sufficient. - I requested a corner and floor level room capsule and was glad I did....less disturbance and easier to enter/exit your room.- There is a secured locker activated by your electronic room wristband and a privacy screen for your room. - Rooms/Beds come in single or double and mattresses are really soft, comfortable and cozy with comforter and pillow.- Solid wifi. USB and AC plugs are located near your head for easy access. Also a handy drop down table for your laptop which folds up and out of your way when you're ready to sleep.- Showers have hot water and include body wash + shampoo dispensers which is a nice touch (towel is included at check-in). - Breakfast includes coffee or tea and 2 slices of bread + jam. Enough to kickstart your day. - In Summary, rooms and bathroom/showers were clean, comfortable and sufficient. Price is very reasonable. I paid under $20 for online booking but assume this is dependent on method of booking, availability and type of accommodations. Will be back as it was very convenient to everything in Kuta.","April 30, 2017","9    H-ostel

Each had a light, outlet and USB plug in. The locks were all along one of the walls. They are self locking ones and the hostel provided the keycard for it. My 40L bag fit in there nicely. Hostel is right in Kuta Square but is surprisingly quiet! Breakfasts are toast and tea or coffee. Staff is very nice. Showers were hot and great water pressure! We ordered a uber to take us to the airport and our driver was worried for safety picking us up in the square by the aggressive taxi drivers. If you order one walk away from the square for pick up!

562,"Good location - official airport taxi was 150000IDR because of the new one-way streets taxis need to drive further to get back to airport and there higher cost. I used the hostel transport to Ubud which was 250000IDR in their van.. Uber would have been about 150000IDR and taxi dependent on traffic. The staff were quite friendly but should have more in-depth info about things like transport options and costs from bus and others. The showers only had hot water 2 / 4 times I used them. Scooter rental was available right from hostel for 75000IDR and lower for older models. GPS around Kuta central isn't accurate and not updated with new one-way streets making it harder to get back to the hostel via scooter. The capsule pods were pretty neat with lights, usb and other types of power sockets. The AC in the room was cold but once you closed the shade of your pod may get a little bit stuffy but nothing really bad. Oddly, during my stay there were no friendly travelers.. i.e. they didn't even respond when you said hi to them. Breakfast was simple toast, coffee, tea but they had many spreads (jam, margarine, peanut butter, chocolate spread).","April 10, 2017","9    H-ostel

The hostel is only about a 20 minute drive from the airport. I was then welcomed by the reception of friendly faces. The mixed dorm is spacious and includes lockers, and the capsule-like beds are amazing... So comfy, the sheets and towel smells so fresh, and include your own charging station and light. The bathrooms are clean. The breakfast is simple, yet a good way to start the day. There are also computers to use and a rooftop! It is walking distance to the beach and heaps of shops and restaurants. I was also able to leave my bigger luggage in a secure room while exploring for a few weeks for a small fee.The best of all though is the staff. Everyone is always so friendly and willing to help you with anything... booking something, explaining words you don't understand, getting transportation... I asked SO MANY QUESTIONS and just wanted to learn, and they were always there to teach me and share with me the beauty and kindness of the Indonesian culture. Special shout out to Ari especially, Faisal, and Sri. They were so beautiful and kind to me, and they were the best first impression that lasted all through out my few weeks adventuring Indonesia... and will be the faces I remember whenever I think of my travels in Indonesia in the future (:","April 9, 2017","9    H-ostel

We arrived at 1 am and of course restaurant was shut but they had sandwiches and fruit in our room. We were on our 10th anniversary and the room was laid out so romantically, with petals and flowers in the bath.Yoga every day, very nice pool, we had a lovely massage included. Breakfasts were so delicious and a good range all freshly cooked in a delightful setting.We normally avoid tourist shows like the plaque but they did Balinese dancing one night with a set meal and it was superb. Lovely intimate setting and the dancing was amazing. Food was really good too!In terms of location too far to walk in to town really but free shuttles laid on. Taxis are cheap back but you have to haggle! Absolutely lovely restaurant , Sacred Rice is two minutes from the hotel and few other places nearby too. Would recommend the morning walk they do too. Get to see more local people and sites and visit lovely coffee plantation and try out about 12 teas and coffees(all free!). Yes, the coffees are amazing.Thank you to all the staff, so many were so nice, dont know where to start.......cant wait to come back and we cant give a better recommendation than that.","July 5, 2019","10    Sankara Resort Ubud

The staff are so welcoming and friendly which makes for an amazing stay. The room was really spacious, clean with a great balcony and big bathroom. Every night the mosquito nets were unfolded and room was prepared as well as being cleaned daily. The breakfast was amazing, a la Carte which is much better than buffet! And had great variety. Plus lots of fresh bottled water in your room daily.I would say it was a little noisy to the far left of the property where music and shouting could be heard from the neighbouring resort but luckily the latest that went on was 10/11pm.One great tip I would give is to visit Sacred Rice for lunch or dinner, it’s right beside Sankara and is beautifully romantic with amazing food.Sankara also run an hourly shuttle to and from Ubud centre which is really handy.All in all a very good stay, made especially so by great staff.

582,This hotel was by far the best hotel we stayed in whilst in Bali. From the moment we arrived the hotel staff could not do enough to make you feel at home. The free shuttle was very helpful and the rooms both beautiful and clean. The pool was lovely and the hotel grounds beautiful. We loved our 5 night stay and wish we had booked longer! I cannot recommend this hotel enough! Absolutely amazing and we cannot wait to return.,"June 5, 2019","10    Sankara Resort Ubud

The staff provide excellent concierge service with free shuttle to Ubud.The setting and layout of the grounds are very beautiful. The spa setting and masseurs were the best; definitely do it.

584,"Really amazing property. We stayed in a One Bedroom Pool Villa which was the height of luxury. The staff were all so lovely, the breakfast (included in price) was massive and had several options. We ate dinner there on all 3 nights and each meal was great and also great value for money (NZ$40-60 for dinner and drinks for 2 people).There is a free shuttle bus into Ubud which takes 10 minutes. My only negatives were there was some maintenance work going on and there was loud hammering for several hours each day which was incredibly annoying. Also 2 nights there was loud drum music from the club next door which affected our sleep.We did the free yoga class one morning and it wasn't quite suitable for beginners. I'm not a beginner but my husband is and some poses were inappropriate to encourage inexperienced people to do (wheel pose). Also the lady had her breath instructions the wrong way round (breathe in when it should have been out. I imagine just a language barrier issue though).It's worth going for a walk down the road as there is a small shop (very cheap local beer), another lively restaurant (Bali Pesto) and a pool club (Titi Batu Ubud Club) which has several massive pools, sunloungers, a gym, exercise classes, dancing, restaurants etc.","June 4, 2019","10    Sankara Resort Ubud

586,"Let me say we searched Trip Adviser extensively for the best places to stay in Bali. We eventually settled on Sankara in Ubud and we could not have been happier with the result. There are several things that we loved about this hotel, but out of all of those the most outstanding was the staff and their incredible service that they provided us. Everyone is very nice and always helpful, willing to do whatever they could to make our stay as nice as possible. We stayed in a One Bedroom Pool Villa and it was very nice and relaxing. We loved the amenities that were provided and we enjoyed the private pool right outside of our room. The price of the hotel was well worth it and the help that they provided for our trip was fantastic. The only issue that we had when we arrived was the noise of the outside village. On certain nights the neighboring community center plays loud music well in to the night. The first night that we stayed here the noise kept us up at night, but the next day we requested to move rooms and this was no longer an issue. If you are booking excursions I would recommend you book them directly through trip adviser, since booking them through the hotel might be a few dollars more. However, if you need a private driver or a trip to the city center the hotel is very willing to help.Overall, this hotel was fantastic and I cannot thank the staff enough for making our honeymoon a magical trip. I would absolutely recommend Sankara to anyone that is looking for a quiet oasis tucked in the middle of Ubud. ","June 4, 2019","10    Sankara Resort Ubud

593,"Husband and I spent 4 nights in the Titi Besi room. This a very nice resort on the surface; however, the lack of attention to detail really left us disappointed. Things we liked: —Private pool (in our room)—Strong AC —Good food—Lovely landscaping —Decent bed/pillows—Large tub —Small refrigerator—Helped is quickly coordinate a scooter —Very friendly, well-meaning staff Things we didn’t like:—Painfully slow breakfast service in restaurant. We did it once and gave up. —Never once got our in-room breakfast order right, and we ordered the same thing every day—Only provided 4 small bottles of water to drink per day. We had to go to the store and bring in our own. Other hotels had in-room water coolers. —Wooden lip around bed wrecked our shins. Bad design. —Long, uneven walk to lobby (not great for older or partially disabled) —Very difficult to communicate with staff. I don’t expect them to speak English, but just know that you’ll struggle at times. —VERY loud health club next door—basketball, skate park, kids swimming, DJs until 10pm, Ex-pat American hippies singing chants —Dog barked one evening right outside our room for 4 hours straight—Shower has only 1 glass wall, water goes everywhere, all over the floor. Bad design. —No in-room coffee maker, just instant coffee and a kettle with no creamer and no stirrers —Didn’t replace hand towels 2x—Sent us a random bill in the middle of the stay with no explanation. Turned out to be “a mistake.” I really wanted to like this place. Based on the reviews it seemed like this place would be top notch. It really isn’t. Of the four properties we stayed at while in Bali, this was the worst by far. ","May 13, 2019","10    Sankara Resort Ubud

Upon arriving at the resort we were met by smiling welcoming faces and that continued throughout our entire stay. It was amazing after a long day of walking around Ubud to be greeted with “Welcome home!” We really did feel like we were at home!The room we stayed in was gorgeous. The private pool was so nice to relax in. The room was very comfortable and had plenty of room. I especially liked the open bathroom set up. You felt like you were showering and bathing right in the middle of the jungle.We enjoyed the resorts restaurant 3-4 times for breakfast and lunch. The food was very good and although it doesn’t seem like a lot in quantity, it is sure to fill you up. I especially liked the various smoothies they offered.While at Sankara we indulged in the Spa services. We decided on the couples package and couldn’t have been more impressed. It was a very relaxing massage and facial that I wish would never end. I do not remember the drivers names (I believe we had 2 different men) that operated the shuttle, but I especially wanted to thank them. They were very pleasant during our rides downtown and were always very accessible if our schedule changed.Thank you to everyone that works at the Sankara Resort.

There are a lot of lizards/ insects around with the resort being located in the rice fields and we spent one night with some sort of creature, possibly a tree frog, making noises in the rafters of our room! However it’s definitely worth putting up with a few creatures to stay in such peaceful and beautiful settings. The staff are extremely helpful and the shuttle bus to and from ubud is excellent.

605,"The staff at Sankara are so welcoming and helpful, they really made our stay. I would highly recommend this hotel.We were greeted with a welcome drink and our room was ready before check-in, bonus!Food- we stayed on a bed and breakfast basis. There was a good choice from the menu and it was all table service. The food was high quality. We ate at the restaurant most nights, it was a similar price to eating in Ubud and it was delicious. Try the cashew chicken. The hotel offers a complimentary afternoon tea between 3-5pm which was a pot of tea and three mini cakes on a tasting plate.Room - it was spacious and had everything we needed. The air conditioning was fantastic. Mini bar items were very reasonable. The room was cleaned twice a day. Amenities- the pool was clean and a refreshing break from the heat. There are only 8 sun beds around the pool, it is quiet most of the time but it was full one afternoon so we couldn’t get a bed. A few more sun beds or chairs would be good. The spa treatments are fantastic! It was about £22 for an hour massage. The hotel is a 10 min drive from Ubud, they offer a free shuttle service every hour until 10pm, this made getting to and from Ubud very easy. Great wi-fi. Staff- every single member of staff we met were so friendly and some knew our names after the first day (the has never happened before) a shout out to Merry and IB who were just amazing.

Good shuttle service for the city center of Ubud (free) and well organized SPA with skilled staff. Food is delicious, try the Pad Thai, probably the best I’ve ever eaten.

I asked the resort to organise something special for my daughter before our arrival and this was expertly taken care of. The staff also went over and above to prepare our room as a surprise for my daughter. The comfort of the beds also is outstanding. I highly recommend Sankara Resort as a wonderful destination in Ubud. Will definitely return. Won’t mention any staff names, as everyone provides an exemplary friendly service, and work really hard to provide a holiday experience that you won’t forget.

620,"Every hotel in Ubud has the luxury of a gorgeous landscape and beautiful views, so it is not the beauty of Sankara Ubud that sets this resort apart. Rather, it is how detail-oriented, authentically caring, and devoted every member of the staff is. From the moment my grandfather and I stepped onto the property, we were well and truly taken care of. Every single request we had was answered and the staff, especially Suartama, Merry, and Ngurah, greeted us continuously with an authentic smile, a desire to help, and always the question, “Is there anything else I can do to make you more comfortable?” This resort deserves a 5-star rating and all the praise in the world.","February 23, 2019","10    Sankara Resort Ubud

621,"You know how it is - you search for a hotel and read all the positive reviews on TripAdvisor and sometimes doubt if the hotel really is THAT great. Well, Sankara Ubud, certainly deserves its great reviews. Our family stayed for 4 nights and in hindsight we wish we would have booked a longer stay. The hotel is great, very relaxing atmosphere, super nice rooms/villas and so on. We enjoyed the beautiful infinity pool every day at different times and almost always had it for ourselves. Also got a very relaxing massage in the spa. But the best thing about Sankara is the amazing and genuinely friendly staff that goes out of their way to make you feel comfortable. We stayed in several hotels in Bali and staff is usually nice, but Sankara was a totally different experience. Among other things we really appreciated that they took care of our little toddler at breakfast and when we had lunch at the hotel so we could eat in peace. And our son sure loved the extra attention he got :)Just as it says in many reviews the location is a bit outside central Ubud. Which in my opinion is to prefer because it’s located in a more peaceful environment. Very easy to use the free shuttle to go to and from town. There are places to eat close to the hotel too and one of the best restaurants in Ubud, Sacred Rice, is just around the corner. Make sure to make a reservation because they only seat 28 guests for dinner.The complimentary morning walk was definitely worth getting up a bit earlier for. Interesting to see the surroundings and to do coffee tasting at Ubud Sari. There’s also a sports club next door with gym, playgrounds for children and a lot of other activities. Another tip is to use the laundry service on the opposite side of the hotel entrance. Only 10 k idr for 1 kg. Really loved our stay. Hope to be back one day!

625,"We stayed three nights in the South Village which is great as it's nearer to the beach. We were initially given a room in the West Village but asked to change and the hotel kindly obliged. The stay was great. The hotel has a beautiful and clean private beach. It is a short walk to Bali Collection - a ""village"" of restaurants, shops and even a supermarket - so it's convenient for when you don't want to dine in-house. Otherwise, there's a few shops and quite a number of restaurants within the hotel too. We were at the first floor and loved it. Our terrace overlooks a pond with ducks every morning. We can see the sea too. While the room is not spanking new, it's comfortable. Room service is a bit of a hit-and-miss depending on the food you order. Love dishes tend to be bland (perhaps catering to Caucasian taste buds) but dishes like fish and chips are okay. Overall, we enjoyed our stay. Thanks, Frnd Hyatt!

We were 2 families and had the best time enjoying its facilities. in addition, we are vegetarians with further dietary restrictions. Luckily, every day, Chef Ashish, Lia and her team made it exceptionally easy for us to have food. If you are a vegetarian and have Jain food dietary restrictions, this is the hotel to stay, where i highly recommend Chef Ashish's culinary skills. The room we had was nicely positioned between the lobby and various pools, and nusa dua beach. Overall, we had a great time at Grand Hyatt!

627,"The first room we were taken to was old and smelled very musty .I think the culprit was the bamboo blinds and the fabric on the old daybed. It was also a long walk to the lobby and other facilities. The next morning we asked to change to another room, this was not much better so we declined and asked for another. They took us to the North wing and the room had been renovated. This room was much better. It was also very close to the Lobby, the Garden Cafe for breakfast and the balinese pool. The resort itself has over 600 rooms and four wings North, South East and West. Not good for people with disabilities as can involve a lot of walking, easy to get lost and hard to navigate your way around. We couldn't find our first room very easily. The grounds are beautifully landscaped with flowers, frangipani trees, water lily ponds. Staff always sweeping and cleaning. Great choices of restaurants. Food is good at Salsa Verde and the Garden cafe but reasonably expensive. We didnt try the other restaurants.We used the lovely balinese pool near our room which was great as not many people were using it. The pools at the front looked great for kids and adults and close to the Salsa Verde Restaurant and beach. There are also some sun loungers on the beach and this area is great! Bali Collection is just across the road and the Water blow hole quite close. Also have a few shops in the resort. We missed out on the cultural evening with dancing as it was at another of the resorts restaurants. We asked if we could sit down for 5 mins to watch as there were plenty of chairs outside. They asked us to pay - Ive forgotten how much. We declined as we didn't think we should pay since we had only just eaten at one of the resorts other restaurants. Management should address this! Good location in Nusa Dua. Overall it is a lovely resort it was a great experience.","July 7, 2019","11    Grand Hyatt Bali

631,"This was our first trip to bali and we did it in style. This vast and beautiful resort was great for our family of four. We had a suite which was big, beautiful and had amazing ocean views. The grounds are impeccably kept and every where you look there is something interesting to look at. The staff at all the restaurants were friendly and accommodating.The waterslide entertained our two active sons for hours which was a good thing as there is an additional and expensive charge for the Kids' Club at the Hyatt that I didn't appreciate so we didn't use it. This is generally my only criticism. The cultural shows each night were just wonderful. The direct beach access and beautiful breezes make the resort such a pleasure. There are other reviews that make a great deal about renos being required but that was not our impression at all. My only suggestion to the management would be that at the time of checking in it would be nice if a staff member spent a bit of time taking you through how things work eg. where are kids allowed and not allowed, what are the hours and rates for kids club, what time does the slide and pools close each evening what time does breakfast start and which restaurants serve it -that sort of thing just to give you more orientation. We worked these things out anyway but some info would've helped and perhaps in their defence I guess we could've asked. Food at the various restaurants were similar prices to Sydney but that is to be expected at a resort of this standing. I would certainly return to the Hyatt and have no problem recommending it to others.","July 4, 2019","11    Grand Hyatt Bali

632,"We stayed here for 5 nights and on the whole the place was brilliant, but, one big problem let it down.... I kept waking in the night hearing strange noises. One night I got up and spotted a mouse in the room which then quickly ran away and into a void the ceiling. I had a look and spotted that the mice hand made holes behind the spotlights to get in the room. This was quite concerning due to hygiene concerns with food being out etc. I'd also had lots of disturbed nights sleep. The management at the hotel said they would get pest control out to have a look while we were out, but it turns out all they did was spra something - they did not attempt to block to the holes where the mice were getting in. We were offered a free meal, which was not satisfactory in my opinion. This a top class hotel and for this sort of thing to happen and then be treated with such disregard is really disappointing.","July 3, 2019","11    Grand Hyatt Bali

633,"We stayed in this resort on June 2019 for 3 nights in connecting rooms 1436 and 1437. We bought the voucher by travel agent, got cheaper price even when compared with World of Hyatt member rate. Breakfast for 2 person is included. I usually book the hotel stays by their own websites. Because sometimes I got free room upgrade or else. So I expect nothing here. Check in time was longer than usual. Maybe because of high season. We got our room at 3:00 PM just at the normal check in time. Waited for about 1 hour but we got Veranda beverage voucher so we can wait more comfortably. Rooms a bit old but comfortable and the air con works well. The amenities were missed here and there (no toothbrushes), but we can call the housekeeping and they will provide. Keep in mind that the resort is very huge. We got lost on the first day during our walk from the beach area. There are 2 restaurants used for breakfast. The one near the lobby and Salsa Verde near the pool and beach area. Breakfast was good. I love that they serve honey pork slices on breakfast stall. The best part of the resort is their beach. We stayed at Inaya Putri and Ayodya Resort just on the other side of Grand Hyatt area, but Grand Hyatt beach is the best by far (The beaches on these three resorts are the best to play with kids and dip around Nusa Dua). Hugh beach area, because the resort itself is huge. Good tides during our stays. At noon there were no tides really. You can just dip and sit in the shallow water. Heaven. My son and daughter, 8 and 5 years old loves the beach and pools so much. We love the lush garden with the shallow ‘umbrella’ trees too. Good job Grand Hyatt Bali. I hope to visit the resort again in the future with my family. Hope to get a better room next time. Oh and at night we can spend time chill at the Bali Collection.

635,"Bali is beautiful, but what we will remember most is how the staff helped me and my wife feel so valued and cared for. They went above and beyond at every juncture and made this stay amazing.Susanto the manager was so helpful for navigating tough issues. our AC stopped working and he helped us get in another room in the middle of the night. Even helped us with getting back to airport safely.I've always wondered what the concierge does, but Unita and Sukriani helped me see them in action. They called the airline on behalf of me and my wife when we got stuck on Gili Islands due to bad weather. Unita worked tirelessly to find a way to get my sick wife home even when my passport was locked away in our room safe many miles away. From start to finish she took care of all our appointments and arranged our transportation. They took care of all our contacts outside of the hotel.We will always remember the kind service of these people, but every Kriya Spa attendant, room service person, technician, and housekeeping member was professional and kept our needs first. We saw some foreign guests during our trip discontent with service they felt entitled to, inside the hotel and outside as well. Although people make mistakes and fail our expectations at times, Grand Hyatt staff and the Indonesian people really do give it their all to consider the guest more important than themselves.

Our room overlooked the tranquil emerald pool which is a great spot sit or swim for a few hours as it is away from the other pools and noise. We stayed for 8 nights and intentionally chose to stay at the Grand Hyatt for the first part of our Bali holiday to unwind and relax. The resort is full of Balinese architecture and the gardens are beautifully maintained. We loved how expansive the grounds are. We visited the Kriya Spa a number of times and the surrounds and service there are outstanding (tranquil and professional). Staff were incredibly helpful and cheery at all times. The room we had is a little tired but everything was in working order, the bed was comfortable, the air con worked perfectly and everything was clean so we had no complaints at all. The resort is in a great location and the beach at the front is kept immaculately. We ate at the Salse Verde and Garden Cafe (buffet breakfast) and the food was great. The cultural night dinner is a must. The entertainment and food was fantastic. Breakfast got a little busy but that is no different to every other hotel we have stayed at that supplies a Buffet breakfast.

650,"Wow, we just had a great holiday through lux escapes staying for 10 nights with breakfast and dinners included. The hotel is everything you would hope for as far as a tropical holiday with fantastic service, rooms, food, pools and beach. Unfortunately though, despite the deal we purchased stating ""And don’t forget children aged 11 years and under stay free with breakfast - now that’s holidaying!”Kids under 3 aren’t allowed in the kids club. I don’t know about you but my definition of little one means kids including under 3 unless stated otherwise. Other places we have been to allow either a parent or guardian to accompany kids under 3 into the kids club but this place doesn’t allow that. As we have a 2 and 4 year old, the kids club was useless as our 2 year old would just lose it if we tried to put the 4 year old in without him. Even for kids over 3 you have to pay in 2 hour blocks or for half/full days. We wouldn’t have minded paying but this should also be advertised. From our observation alone it looks like a good kids club for those that are allowed to use it. Noting we purchased through lux escapes and it was their description that failed to mention this rule this is their fault (it is on the Hyatt’s direct website but we didn’t think to check that before staying there)I would happily recommend the resort to anyone who doesn’t want kids club for under 3s","June 17, 2019","11    Grand Hyatt Bali

Everyone we met was friendly and professional.We are big fans of Hyatt and so we have stayed in many Hyatt's across the globe and this Grand Hyatt matches up well with our expectations. The Grand Club lounge is beautiful and well worth the upgrade cost. We enjoyed the ambiance of the open air lounge as much as we did the food and service.The Italian restaurant on site was amazing. We normally try to only eat the local food on trips because we enjoy discovering new food we might like but when we did end up eating at this restaurant at the end of our stay, we wish we would have found it earlier in the week. We did leave an item behind in a public restroom on the day we were checking out. After we left, we contacted the hotel, they located the item, and have made arrangements to return the item. We have not received the item yet but the communication with the hotel staff has been great. Overall, the resort is pretty affordable for the quality of the resort. The reason for a 4 star instead of a 5 rating is that it's an older resort and the lack of personal service touches from most of the staff, even in the Grand Club.","June 17, 2019","11    Grand Hyatt Bali

659,"Best Room: We LOVED room 3107.Best hotel: Grand Hyatt Bali!! It's soooo beautiful, classy and has the best service of anywhere we've EVER stayed!Tip: If you have food allergies, let them know ahead of time. Octarina was the one I emailed and she was so friendly and helpful plus fantastic in letting all their restaurants on the premises know about my food allergies.My impressions of the resort:You really realise where you’re staying is truly special, especially as soon as you walk out the beach-side gates. There is a footpath (or sidewalk) that runs alongside the beach. You can walk through the gates to access other properties. As soon as you do, you feel like you’ve left a tranquil, wonderful paradise behind and entered reality.The beach becomes more narrow. Lounge chairs are crowded next to each other, almost touching and there are rows of them all close together. There are so many people and you’re forced to walk the gauntlet through rows of vendors hawking their wares. Maybe a good place if you’re a kid going on Spring Break. But I want a tranquil haven so I turn around and walk back through the gates to the Grand Hyatt. As soon as you enter The Grand Hyatt grounds, the beach is wider and more spacious. There are beautiful shade trees that have lounge chair underneath and beside. I go back, find my husband and I lay on lounge chairs all day because they’re so comfortable. You can stay in the shade or sun without anyone close to you except occasionally friendly waiters to bring you refreshing drinks. It’s like living in a Corona commercial.TIP: the bar usually runs specials so ask your helpful waiter about them. If the beer special is buy three (or more) at a special price, ask him to bring them in a bucket of ice to keep them cold.TIP: they now carry Prost beer. Give it a try because it’s even cheaper than Bintang and my husband said he liked it better.TIP: As for Masmita - he did a wonderful job bringing us beer and wine.If you decide to go to the pool, you have plenty of different types of pools to choose from.TIP: if you get too hot, ask where the Cool Plunge pool is to cool off. It’s next to the hot tub.TIP: ask for two towels instead of one at the towel stand. It will always come in handy.TIP: if you have food allergies or special requests, be sure to email them in advance so that they can best accommodate you.I usually dread travelling because my allergies make it difficult. But I don’t worry when I come to the Grand Hyatt. This is our second stay here and the staff here is so fantastic.From the moment we arrived, we were greeted by name and remembered by old friends Heru and Roro. In fact, we saw several Hyatt employees that still work there that we met three years ago. It says a lot for a place that treats its staff so well that they work there long term.We were treated like celebrities. Not only was my food allergen-free, it was deliciously prepared and charmingly served. Everyone was great: from the room cleaner, room service, chefs, servers and managers.I can’t name everyone but here are some star performers.TIP: if you need excellent advice, ask for Heru at the Concierge desk.TIP: if you go to the Garden cafe, Adi S and Roro are wonderful managers.Dewi: always remembered our name and room numberExcellent servers were Yumi, Siti Sri.A and Arti.The Chefs, Sudiata and Widi both came out to discuss how to best accommodate my food allergies.TIP: at Salsa verde, ask for Meri, Roy, or Perry.TIP: go to the Salsa Bar at sunset. It is located above Salsa Verde and has the best views. Ask for Sartika or Tansana.Best TIP: get the upgrades. You’ll be glad you did.","June 10, 2019","11    Grand Hyatt Bali

The hotel has their own private beach, real nice and clean, happy to see my daughter enjoyed playing here5. Walking distance to bali collection6. Breakfast was just ok, ( for those who never stay in this hotel, when you get your room, ask where is the breakfast for your area, we didnt get the information as we walked quite a distance to a restaurant near the loby just to get turned down as our room number was not supposed to have breakfast there,little bit upsetting)7. The hotel is quite old, so dont expect too much, for example our room8. The baby cot we asked for is dirty, we ended up not using it9.

672,"Stay Duration: Three nightsTotal Guests: 4 adults and 2 kids in 2 roomsWhat we sought out: Our two families wanted rooms close to each other in a hotel which had a lot of moving space, easy access to clean beach, good food and a quiet place for the adults to relax. Verdict on our expectations: Met on all counts and exceeded on a few. Location: We were told time and time again that Kuta/Seminyak was the place to be when in Bali, but we decided against all those advice and chose Nusa Dua, specifically Hyatt. A great decision!! The beach was so close, so clean and beautiful! Its in the newly developed Nusa Dua area and therefore is humongous in hotel grounds. We later found out that its walk-able distance to the Bali collection shopping mall - shops and restaurants are super close. But if you are looking for an active night life, this may not be for you, as this area is geared more towards a relaxed and laid back atmosphere. Room: Our room was perfect! It was decent sized with a separate bed in a nook for our boy. The bed was comfortable with pillows of different softness. The linens were clean. We had the garden view in one of the rooms where there were no railings separating the room and the garden. Both us and birds were crossing each other's territories pleasantly. But closeness to the garden also brought some small millipedes in. We just flicked it out and made sure the lights were off. Bathroom: Separate shower cubicle and a bath tub. Really clean at all times. Wardrobe closet available within the bathroom area for easy access. Only one pet peeve is, could've used a lock on the room to prevent little ones running in unannounced. The bathroom wooden door also got stuck a little bit, preventing it from being closed fully, as it might have expanded due to the heat and ocean air. Food: We had visited only Garden Cafe and Salsa Verde during our stay. Our first day lunch was in Salsa Verde and it was really really good. Sizable portions of tasty food! There were enough vegetarian options available for us to choose from. The staff were very courteous and friendly. We spent almost 2 hours of our first day just relishing the food and atmosphere there. All our subsequent breakfasts were in Garden Cafe. The breakfast buffet spread was huge and varied! It did get a bit crowded in the mornings and that's the only time you realize that there are so many guests in the hotel. The staff therefore got a bit frazzled and curt, but nothing major as to be a turnoff. One lunch that we had there wasn't noteworthy. Pool and Ocean: The pool was really nice and very kid friendly with water slides. But the ocean is the big attraction. The beach was very clean and we actually witnessed it being cleaned every morning around sunrise. Lots of loungers with sufficient tree shades. A beautiful swing right in the middle of the beach for those instagram clicks. I could've spent our whole vacation in that beach, just lazing and reading a book! But note that the waves are not for surfing, they were more mellow. Grounds and others: The hotel grounds were beautiful with many water bodies with beautiful water lilies. There were birds, aerial and aquatic - freely and unobtrusively going around. The small bridges that dot the grounds are so cute. There are enough clothes, knick knacks and toy shops within the hotel premise, not to mention an ATM, a money exchange, a small temple, a conference center, a wedding area, a kid club etc etc. The hotel itself is so huge that its easy to get lost. During couple of our walks, we had to refer to strategically placed maps to find our way back. Transport: They arranged our airport pick up in a big vehicle (Toyata Hiace). The pick up was smooth and went okay without any hitches. Check-in/Check-out: Again smooth - no hitches. A must stay if you would like to have a quiet place away from the hustle and bustle.","May 27, 2019","11    Grand Hyatt Bali

673,"We had booked ocean view but when we checked in , we were told that it has been upgraded to Executive view. Not sure , why someone will upgrade unless there is some issue with the booked room .I expressed my wish to get me the same type of room which I had booked, but that might not be available. Though, I had the ocean view from my room but it was little far. That is still ok. The only problem is , It should be communicated with customer in advance , so they wont be surprised at the last moment. That was the only concern.Otherwise, it is a very awesome and large property. You have ATM, Shops , Restaurant etc. Staff is friendly. For vegetarian , there are very less options. For non-veg, there are plenty.

674,"This was the largest resort we stayed at while in Bali (out of 6 resorts). This place had consistent hot water and water pressure, major plus in my book. The room was nice, it overlooked the golf course, lotus pond and had a beautiful ocean view. I did get a picture of a Monitor Lizard (maybe a Komodo?). Lots of wild life here (not in the room, no critters spotted in the room).Check in was nice, staff was pleasant and welcoming. They have a little shopping village on premises (and are right next door to the Bali Collection). Room is a good walk to the front desk area. Beach area is very nice, kid friendly. Nice water slide and pool area. Great pizza at the Italian Restaurant!They were having a conference when we were there. Prices seemed to reflect this as we were quoted $29 USD for a ride to the airport. We called our driver we had used during the week- $15. The room itself was the smallest we had stayed in during the 12 days in Bali but it was still very comfortable, and once again, they did have the best water pressure! Check out was smooth even with the buses of Chinese guests leaving at the same time as us.","May 26, 2019","11    Grand Hyatt Bali

Untrained and very poor comprehension added to the problem. Croissants and bread was stale. The suite was a lovely size and well appointed. However the bed curtains were torn and lacked a privacy partition between the bedroom and bathroom especially if traveling with friends, this is a big problem. Overall the property is quite old, but maintained well. However it is not worth the price at all compared to several other hotels in Bali. And most disappointing is the poor standard of training and service offered by the staff on several points of contact. I would not recommend this property. And will never go there again anytime soon.

678,"We stayed in een mezzanine room at Bali Bohemia Huts for two night. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Location next to south entrance of Monkey Forest. Still quite far from ‘downtown’, you need a taxi or ascooter. There’s a lot of attention to decoration (a bit hysterical in my opinion), but not too much on practical things. Adequate lighting was missing, so in the evening we could barely see anything. No closet or place to store clothes/suitcase and no curtains on the window behind the bed so we woke up when the sun rises. Swimmingpool is pretty small and the evening when we arrived there was an ‘open mic’ evening, which caused a lot of noise. All in all it’s pretty expensive for what you get. We were quite happy to relocate after two days to a more central ánd more scenic location with 2 large swimmingpools, a bigger room, free shuttle service around town for only half the price of Bali Bohemia!

682,"Had a lovely welcome from the staff upon arrival as we were greeted with welcome drinks. We had the deluxe mezzanine room which was lovely and we were also visited a few times by some cheeky monkeys on our balcony. It is about a 10 minute walk to the main strip into town via a narrow route next to the monkey forest which is shared with many mopeds, so you must walk with caution if you take that route so be prepared to walk slowly and in single file. As a whole, our stay with Bali Bohemia was lovely and we probably would stay there again... The only reason we have not given 5 star rating was that we were made to feel quite uncomfortable upon check out, when 2 members of the team (who we thought were coming to help with our bags) burst into our room and were running around checking we had not taken anything... Which is understandable but not very nice whilst we were still in the room! In addition, we were questioned about the location of the small bottle of mosquito repellant they had provided alongside shampoo and shower gel. We didn't know where it was and were made to pay for it - a small amount but strange nonetheless when this has been provided for use free of charge, and we assume no charge would have been made were the empty bottle left on the room. We felt this wasn't dealt with particularly professionally or in the manner we had been accustomed to from otherwise very kind and pleasant staff.The restaurant is great, breakfast is fantastic and lots of options, we enjoyed the stay but were disappointed by how it ended.","May 2, 2019","12    Bali Bohemia Huts

691,"A night on my own before the start of my holiday with my husband. The resort is tucked away but very close to Ubud town and across the road from the monkey forest. My mezzanine 'heart' room was perfect. It had a suspended egg chair on my deck that was very comfy to read in, and i had the pool all to myself for a few hours to float around in. I had a healing massage from Wayan which was fantastic ($20).The staff are super friendly and welcoming and breakfast was delicious, ordering from a choice of 3 menu.There are things that some may not like: monkeys are very close and sometimes roaming the resort. (Tho, I loved watching the babys play during breakfast). The balcony rail could be a safety risk as it didnt seem that secure (this does need to be fixed). As the roof is very high, the air conditioning did not seem powerful enough for the size of space, so while in bed it was warm and the mozzie net couldnt be used as this made it even more uncomfortable (this may not seem as bad in peak season?).Otherwise, the location was great, and i loved the individual artwork everywhere.

692,"My partner and I stayed here at the end of October for three nights.   *Room* We stayed in Wonder, which is one of the deluxe rooms with the bed on a mezzanine level. The room was spotlessly clean, and we loved the quirky decor. Although we had air conditioning and a fan in our room, we did find it quite hot in the night… I think the thick mosquito net kept all the heat in! The only thing the rooms was really missing was somewhere to hang clothes, or a place to put our cases. Not a huge problem because we were only there a few days, but some may find it annoying. *Pool*There is a great little pool area with lots of seating options (sunbeds and bean bags!) It was very quiet during our stay so we often had it all to ourselves. Occasionally the monkeys pop by for a visit which was a little intimidating for me, but the staff quickly came to our rescue!  *Breakfast* Breakfast is served in the restaurant just outside the complex, and it was consistently great… easily one of the best we had during our stay in Bali. There were so many western and Indonesian options, and portion sizes were generous.   *Location* The huts are situated right next to the Monkey Forest. In fact, to get to the centre of Ubud with all the bars and restaurants, you need to walk for 5-10 minutes along a path through the forest itself. Ideally you’ll need a torch to watch where you are going, but we actually managed the first night without one since there was always a number of mopeds going by to light the way!  *Finally* One of the best aspects of this hotel were the staff, who made us feel so welcome and always looked genuinely pleased to see you! I would recommend Bali Bohemia Huts to anyone wanting to stay somewhere a little different and close to the centre of Ubud.","February 10, 2019","12    Bali Bohemia Huts

Sitting on our balcony the music was just loud enough to enjoy, but didn't disturb us in our room. The food here was a good standard, we had breakfast every day, but only ate once in the evening as the menu choice wasn't to our taste, but lots of local restaurants nearby serving great Indonesian food. There are monkeys around at this hotel! We weren't stupid enough to eat on our balcony, but they were still a nuisance at times. We had to bring our drying rack inside as they will take anything - yes I did get my bikini back!This is a lovely area just out from the centre of Ubud, with a 15min walk down a path into the town which was a bit like running the gauntlet of monkeys and motorbikes but we didn't have any problems, although we used a taxi at night.","August 31, 2018","12    Bali Bohemia Huts

It was very quiet and peaceful and a great place to relax. The food at the restaurant was different, but very tasty and very nicely presented. My only concern was the proximity to the Monkey Forest, they visit daily to find food which we found a bit intimidating, but staff arm you with a sling shot and they are usually on guard too. You are a bit out from the city centre, but taxis are available and cheap and there are some very nice eating places nearby. You can take the shortcut into town via a walkway next to the Monkey Forest, but after being confronted by a monkey on our first morning, we didn’t attempt it again.

The friendliness of the staff and the intimacy of the venue made for a stay that exceeded our expectations quite considerably.- The rooms were full of character, clean, spacious, comfy and very unique.- The food was some of the best we tried in our 18-day stay in Bali. - The staff were by far the most friendly we have encountered on our global travels. - The setting, 5metres from the Monkey Forest, made for an environment we will never be able to replicate. - The walking-distance proximity to central Ubud made everything very accessible. - The unique decor and atmosphere meant it took hours to relax, not days. - The price was incredibly good value. It didn't break the bank, in fact, quite the opposite.Most importantly, Jessica and her staff made this stay a 11 out of 10 for us. I wish I could be as consistently upbeat and as full of energy as her team. Each of them were a pleasure to get to know.You could spend a fortune and stay at a 5* venue with far less character and come away thinking 'that was nice', or stay here, for a very reasonable price, and come away thinking 'that was something special'.

We needed diapers, the found out where you can get diapers without perfume (pampers in the big Delta supermarket). We needed a high chair as we didn’t bring one, they asked their driver to pick up two! One for us and our further travels and one for them :)Right now we’re eating breakfast while the staff is playing with our baby.. what a treat!For reference, our boy is 8 months old.The room we’re staying in is spotless, plenty of hot water, cleaned daily. Pool is good and clean. Breakfast is plentiful and there’s a lot to choose from. Coffee is good and strong!The entrance to the monkey forrest is 20 meters from the hotel.Would I recommend this to friends? Absolutely!","July 12, 2018","12    Bali Bohemia Huts

719,"Spent three nights in this Ubud oasis, set against the monkey forest. Adorable colorful clean huts. Amazing breakfast in their adjoining restaurant, with a great music venue at night! This is the place to be! They also offer a free complimentary airport pick up. We were greeted at the airport by one of their associate guides and driver. We were immediately impressed with him. He presented us with flowers. He spoke english well and we were able to convey to him, what we wanted to see on the island. His name was Deka. He was able to show us things that we would not have known about. We hired him as our driver, he was very considerate and sweet. We enjoyed his company and would highly recommend him!","June 30, 2018","12    Bali Bohemia Huts

720,"Stayed here for 5 nights for a friends wedding a few weeks ago, hired out the place. It was a perfect venue and the brilliant attentive staff made our stay even more special. The bride and groom had their ceremony on the bridge over the pool and 30 guests attended. All the rooms are individually decorated and unique and of the same high quality and standard. We stayed in ‘heart’ which had 2 levels and I think was the closest to the cheeky monkeys who come from the monkey sanctuary next door. Monkey etiquette, don’t smile at them (bare your teeth) don’t carry plastic style bags as they’ll come looking for food! Staff are on hand if they get too close, all you need is the (unarmed) slingshot to make them run, we didn’t have any problems. No mosquito bites either! I Imagine in the ground rooms you don’t get to see as much monkey action! If you have walking difficulties or mobility problems stay in ground rooms as all one level. Two storey rooms had tricky wood steps leading to bedroom, bathroom downstairs. Potentially dangerous for elderly or frail. ALL rooms unique and are kept equally to a high standard and decor, all rooms with varranda or balcony face the pool and gardens. Breakfast was amazing, on the hungover morning post wedding celebrations staff brought breakfast and a herbal tea to our balcony! The town is an interesting 10 min walk through a wide path through jungle, wide enough for walkers and scooters and monkeys! The people are lovely and I felt no threat walking alone, even did so at 10pm after a massage in town! Must add, on site massage better! It’s a very slow pace of life here and you’ll never want to leave, hidden from roads and any noise. All staff are just wonderful and can’t do enough to help. Thank you to all who made Laura and Toms wedding celebrations such a perfect day and night.","June 15, 2018","12    Bali Bohemia Huts

721,"Spent three nights here recently with a friend in a mezzanine room. We couldn’t fault the place. It was as perfect if not better than the photos. It was peaceful (be prepared for music nights in the restaurant a couple of nights a week), extremely helpful, friendly smiling staff, went out of their way to help, amazing rooms, spotlessly clean, beautiful decor and the food was amazing. We ate dinner elsewhere one night and wished we had stayed where we were. Right near the back entrance to the Monkey Forest so you can sit in the restaurant and watch the world go by and the antics of the monkeys. No need to pay to go inside. A short 5 minute walk along a path into the town which runs alongside the forest as well. Try the massage, an hour was not enough! Transport to and from Bali Bohemia was by the driver Deka, he was fantastic and so sweet, we miss his laugh and great music in the car.

They had these little reggae music at night and it was the best. And also don’t be scared at night if you hear a sound of hitting on the door as that’s not a robber or someone it’s definitely a monkey hitting on your door so just keep jigging with it. ✌️Enjoy the trip I recommend this place 10 out of 10","May 22, 2018","12    Bali Bohemia Huts

I recommend day trips that to rice fields, waterfalls, temples or even Ubud when weather is poor. On sunny days great for pool area. Resort is beautiful however the service is not 5 star.

To wake each morning and watch the sun bathing the mountains and hillside outside your room was wonderful. The many reviews we read prior to our visit gave the pool a chilly wrap up but we found our daily 7am swim to be refreshing and no cooler than the ocean at home. The warm shower afterwards was a great way to start the day. We had a great deal of praise for the activities staff who put together a great weeks daily activities . The ones we did were fun, started on time and conducted enthusiastically by the staff. Our room was very nice and the food offered in both restaurants very nice.

The worst breakfast I ever taste and the diarrhea I experienced after.4. Arrogant staff5. Mini bar scam. I called and asked the front desk at the previous evening if the product on the fridge is consumable and complimentary and they said yes. On the we checked out, we are very dissapointed that the man at the front desk told us that it is not complimentary. And forced us to pay the thing that we were told was complimentary.the manager keep saying the whole hotel crew understand that the minibar is not complimentary ,which means I am making up a story so I can steal their cheap sodas.

736,"How would we describe Saranam? Quirky. Some amazing things and some areas that could be improved with just little tweaks.Gorgeous setting with amazing views. It really is up in the mountains, so the weather was variable during our stay - even though it is the dry season - so plan accordingly.Staff helpful and friendly - even when faced with disgruntled guests, they smiled and were courteous. The room - particularly the bed - was lovely with great views.The pool, cafe and gym were excellent. The entertainment was cute but a little amateurish and there was nothing to do once dinner was eaten. Luckily the TV signal and wifi were good!So now for the easy fixes:1. Bedroom - the musky smell comes from the heat and humidity - we recognise that - but the mould in the shower - behind the shower door - could easily be removed.2. The yoga studio mats are very thin and not nice - need to be replaced more often.3. The food - the set menu choice is too limited - needs to change more often. We didn't know that dinner was either a buffet or set menu until we arrived at the resto the 1st night. To our palette the buffet food was ok but not hot enough and not replenished quickly enough. Same for breakfast - the egg ordering was not efficient but the omelette was lovely once it appeared. Wine was super expensive for average wine and they ran out of rosé twice while we were there.4. Lovely swimming pool - although a bit chilly. The sunbeds however, while comfortable, were very stained.5. Post dinner - why not keep the Café Toya open later into the evening for guests who just want to chill and chat - I am sure us Luxury Escapes clients would all spend even more money that way ;)6. Saranam Resort and SPA - basically 2 bedrooms. I have a very keen sense of smell and the fausty smell of the eye masks and covers was not compelling. For our included massage, there was no music - which was ok as we could running water - until someone started banging something and moving furniture in the room above. I asked if we could have some music and the masseuse said it was not working in the room but she could put her phone on - better than nothing. The actual massage was excellent - one of the best we have had.Would we come back? No, but mainly because there are so many places to go...","June 4, 2019","13    Saranam Resort & Spa

737,"We loved every moment of our stay at Saranam. Peaceful area, good location for sightseeing in the north of Bali. Lots of tours operated from the hotel daily with a good range of options. We chose the trip to Jatiluwih rice terraces and the temple lake at Candi Kuning. They can also take you to the Git Git waterfalls and Pacung village. We requested a private trip to Sangeh monkey forest (better than the Ubud forest in some people's opinion).Delicious Balinese options at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Had an amazing view down from L'Altitude restaurant, which is at the very top of the resort, every day. Great place for kids. The kids club is super cute and has a huge cubby house. Not many children here so sometimes the room is not attended. This was fine with us as we wanted to stay and play with her. Good program for older children.Unbelievable warmth and hospitality from all the staff, especially with our 2yo. They let her feed the fish a few times, and won over even our shy toddler. She also loved riding the 'inclinator', a lift from the top to the bottom of the huge property.The spa was modest - not the 'luxury' spa some people might expect from a luxury resort - but the staff were very good at their jobs. We added extra massages to what was offered in our package. Our favourite place was definitely the pool. Perfect water temperature and well taken care of, surrounded by lush gardens. Relaxing music from nearby Cafe Toya and lots of daybeds on the lawn to stretch out on. Good rain showers for a post-swim rinse.Rooms were lovely. Bed soft and luxurious. Again, great views from our suite. While we loved this place, here are a few things we would suggest:- offer room service dining option as part of package deals (we have a little child so sometimes couldn't make it to dinner if she fell asleep)- quicker check-in when arriving late at night - less soft drinks in the mini-bar please (coke and sprite are not the healthiest options)","May 26, 2019","13    Saranam Resort & Spa

The LE package means you are offered a set menu separate to the a la carte menu, and although limiting after a week you can still have the normal menu and the value of your LE meal is deducted from the price. We spoilt ourselves with pre booking 4 sessions at the day spa so that we wouldn't miss out, and ended up adding more once we got there as the experience was so good. The view from our balcony and the dining area was stunning and would never get tired. Highlights would be the Spice Class with Giday the Head Chef and the cooking class with Sandy.

Saranam resort is a hidden gem, surrounded by magnificent views towards the rice paddies and the lush volcano jungles. Saranam staff is the key factor that will make your stay unforgettable; the most caring, loving, kindest and respectful people I’ve come across with. As a bonus they prepare delicious cocktail/mocktail concoctions made with local farmer fruits. Most of Saranam raw ingredients are sourced organic including meat (whenever possible) and from their own veggie garden; their Balinese cuisine dishes were all tasty and delicious. We found everyday a plate of fresh seasonal fruits, bottles of spring bottled water were supplied very often and the mini bar was refill with the same amount of drinks no matter what we had consumed (impossible to get thirsty here) plus the bed open every night while we were having dinner. Plenty of little details that made our stay magical. Highly recommended, especially if you’re interested in knowing a more authentic Bali.","April 28, 2019","13    Saranam Resort & Spa

Please don't get me wrong, the resort is beautiful and has amazing view of the mountain and rice fields, it's for sure enough to make you feel grateful and relaxed. I just hope the resort will keep the beautiful grounds and buildings in best shape for long time to come. When I was there, I noticed few things that are not working like the water fountains along the path down to the pool, it was left empty and looked so sad. I saw signs of wear and tear like chipped tiles of the floor, peeling paints etc which makes me wonder if they notice that and if they do, hopefully they'll make some necessary renovations.

There's literally hardly anything else around close by so you're almost forced to relax. We were pleasantly surprised to the upside with the quality of the food. In fact, the Chef was amazing and bent over backwards to meet our requests. The hotel itself is more than comfortable offering Yoga and meditation every day. The massage that I had at the Spa was probably better than what I had in a more expensive hotel the next week at four times the price.

745,"What a location! The views from the restaurant and rooms here is absolutely spectacular. The pool is a bit chilly but idyllic and every view is to the mountains and rice terraces. Truly gorgeous. We loved our 3 days here and used it as a jumping off point for Jatiluwih, Angseri Hot springs, lake beretan and nearby waterfalls. We rented a car each day for approx 50usd and had a wonderful driver who helped with entrance tickets and booking the private sauna rooms at the hot springs. Staff in the hotel are super friendly. Food is great in the beautiful restaurant. Breakfast buffet is generous with eggs cooked to order and a mix of hot and cold choices. Couple of cons. We originally had a room in the lower building but it was very moldy and immediately our noses started running. The front desk upgraded us to another room in the higher building with no fuss. I think they maybe need to close those lower rooms til the mold is sorted out as it would make guests sick if they slept in there. We have two babies so were compelled to move but I can imagine I might not have bothered if I was alone,and would have ended up really ill. My food was cold a couple of times but they were quick to fix it when I asked. Maybe they need to organise their timings with plating up so stuff doesn't have time to go cold? All in all a wonderful stay. The problems we had were fixed quickly and professionally which is all you need.

We have been waiting 25 minutes for our drinks. No one appears to have a clue what is going on. ,"December 22, 2018","13    Saranam Resort & Spa

750,"Pros:1. Good location. Though it is still 15 minutes to Bedugul, I found the location brilliant. It is surrounded by rice fields and lush forest. The traditional pasar is also near2. Great design. The design perfectly highlights the location and the view. You can see a majestic rice-fields and valley from almost every point of the resort (lobby, restaurant, pool, room)3. Our room is on the higher floor so the view is super beautiful. The room is not too big and not too small but very convenient. Bathroom is spacious. The bed is very comfy. Balcony is large enough for lounging while enjoying the view. Electricity sockets are properly located as well as all lighting switches. We love how practicality is not sacrificed for the sake of design4. The food in the restaurant is amazing especially the desserts. We had a dinner in the restaurant and the lava cake is super. But the hot dishes are also fantastic, Try the chicken thigh it is wonderful. Breakfast menu is pretty limited but again the taste is great. Strawberry juice is lovely5. The service in the restaurant is also fantastic. Our waitress is super friendly and helpful6. The resort offers variety of activities which we love a lot. There are morning yoga, trekking, cooking class, and learning Balinese language7. The swimming pool area is really the highlight of the resort. We really love the view and spaciousness of the area. You can do jogging around the spacious lawn or simply use the gym which located around the swimming pool too. There are enough sun loungers to useCons:1. Our luggage handler is not very friendly and seems in a hurry 2. If only the pool has a heater it would be one of the best hotel pools in mountain area in Bali. The heater might also attract more guests to use it and generate extra revenue for the resort3. The management need to take extra care of the maintenance as some area are dirty and not attended by staff4. The TV is not very clear but this is not very important as we spent most of our time outside our roomOverall, we love this resort and will definitely comeback. As mentioned in the title of my review, this resort has a huge potential to be on par with Padma, Alila, and Maya Ubud. Just need extra promotion and better maintenance to achieve it.","December 8, 2018","13    Saranam Resort & Spa

751,"It was a short wonderful experience. Everything was beyond my expectation. I love the room, I love the stunning Mountain view from my balcony. This Resort surrounded by breathtaking view. It is very good and highly recommended if you want to have a quiet place for escape from your busy routine. The resort offers you many choices of daily activities. Friendly staffs, good service. The lady at the Restaurant were so nice but I didn't know her name. Thank to Mr. Sova (or Sofa?) at the Front Desk he was super kind and helpful. Also Mr. Arta who escorted me upon check in. They were so warm and I feel so comfortable, unfortunately it was a short stay. I wish I could stay longer but I will definitely comeback again next year!!!! Last but not least, Thanks to Mr. Alessandro the General Manager for making my stay memorable, he was so kind.","December 5, 2018","13    Saranam Resort & Spa

752,"What started out as a quick stop for lunch ended up being one of the highlights of our trip. The lunch offering was a buffet that looked incredible but we weren't hungry enough to do it justice. We ordered some delicious a la carte items and were impressed with the views, food and service. What really blew us away was the deal they had offering a one night stay, dinner and breakfast for only 1200000 Rupiah net for TWO PEOPLE! (About $108 Canadian dollars) Even though we had an Air BnB back in Sanur, we decided to stay! This resort has incredible views of rice terraces, mountain vistas and amazing sunsets. The dinner and breakfast were great along with the service. There was a slight mix up when we checked in our room as it wasn't quite ready, but it was a non-issue as we were going to spend some time around the gorgeous infinity pool anyway. When our room was ready, it was clean, comfortable and had all the toiletries we needed as this was an unplanned overnight stay. One of the best parts was when we checked out, a manager apologized for the room not being ready and offered us a free upgrade next time we visit. (Which we intend to do!) It was a non issue and they wanted to make it right regardless. Highly recommended. We wish we have had more time to partake in the many, many activities they offered.","November 23, 2018","13    Saranam Resort & Spa

754,"We spent 5 nights at this resort as we wanted to see another part of Bali and have an opportunity to really relax. This resort enables you to truly relax in beautiful surroundings. The view is absolutely spectacular and you're able to take in the view from your room, from breakfast and from the gym/pool. We were upgraded to a junior suite which we were thankful for as we had a day spa treatment in one of the standard rooms (they had no actual Day Spa set up) and as per other reviews, it was very damp and uncomfortable. Our Junior Suite room was very spacious and comfortable however on our first night we were missing a lot of bits and pieces such as shampoo/conditioner, body wash, milk, and one of our pillows was very dirty. This was all rectified the following day though so no big issue. The main restaurant is a real let down with a very basic and overpriced menu. The cafe down by the pool however, was amazing with so much fresh, delicious food - I highly recommend the buckwheat pasta. The free activities at the resort such as yoga, meditation and Bahasa Indonesia were a great inclusion & lots of fun. There is not much to do within close proximity outside the resort, many guests took a day trip to Ubud. We enjoyed our stay at Saranam Resort but there definitely needs to be better attention to detail to justify a 5* rating.","November 14, 2018","13    Saranam Resort & Spa

756,We have just left Saranam and have to say we were not impressed at all. The view is actually really nice but lack of staff made it very difficult to enjoy our stay. The staff were really nice but you can obviously see that there is not enough of them. There is a restaurant near the pool but when we arrived it was closed due to the toilet issues so there was nobody to serve the drinks. The next day when the large group arrived for the seminar the restaurant was open but had private function but even then we could not order a drink. Obviously the large groups are much more important for them than holiday makers. The food at the restaurant upstairs are trying to be upmarket so it’s overpriced but the food is not that great so we decided to skip few lunches and dinner. ,"November 3, 2018","13    Saranam Resort & Spa

757,"Our first ever 1 star review.Pros: The location of this resort is absolutely, jaw-droppingly beautiful.Cons: Everything else.We paid for a deluxe king room though luxury escapes.We were early for check in on 25/10, as we wanted to make the most of our day. We were told the hotel had no transport and could not organise any transport for us. We wish the resort could have told us this prior to our arrival, as we would have made arrangements ourself. This is very odd, as even our budget accommodation stays have been able to provide this.Luckily, we found a driver off the street. That afternoon we finally checked in. However, we found that construction was taking place directly outside our room. It was extremely noisy, as boulders were being split into pieces and removed from the ground. We were told they could move us to the same type of room, however when we were shown the new room it was actually a downgrade (smaller and only a queen bed). The new room smelt, however we were very tired so tolerated it. We covered the drains and assumed it might dissipate. Wrong. The next morning we awoke feeling nauseas to an extremely strong ammonia gas that was foul, and enough to make one light-headed. It took an hour before a staff member would come to look at it, and the smell was so awful that even with the drains covered the man refused to walk into the bathroom. We could still smell it strongly on the balcony. It was clearly a safety hazard, yet we were offered a de-humidifier at first (from staff who would not enter the room let alone stay in it?!).We've stayed in many places where drain smells are inescapable - but this was different. The gas that was being emitted even after covering the drain and blocking the door with towels was eye-watering.The staff then said they would make up a third room for us on a lower level (a second room downgrade), however we would again have to wait until the afternoon, and by now we had already wasted so much time. We checked online and read reviews from people who left the resort early because the lower levels are very mouldly, which is not suitable as I have asthma and high levels of mould spores would put my health at risk. As a result, we had no choice but to leave. We are extremely disappointed that the room we paid for was not able to be provided, and concerned about the questionable sanitation system of this resort.","October 27, 2018","13    Saranam Resort & Spa

758,"We stayed here for six days and enjoyed every minute. Every day there were at least six activities on offer, all free. There was also one paid excursion that was well worth the money - up to Beretan Lake and the temples there, and then to a local market. Our resort guide was extremely knowledgeable, which made it far more interesting than if we had gone there on our own. It gave us a true feel for the area and the people. Other activities at the resort were yoga, water aerobics, guided walking tour of the local area, etc etc. The nature walk of the rice paddies and organic gardens gave us an insight into traditional farming. The swimming pool was clean, with no chemical odour like some places. Very friendly staff, and the chef was wonderful in catering for my special and complex dietary needs. The massages were divine. Wish we'd booked for a longer stay. I was very pleased that it gave us an opportunity to see how the regional Balinese people live as it's not a ""touristy"" area. But the resort facilities, including our room, were luxurious.","October 16, 2018","13    Saranam Resort & Spa

760,"This was my second stay at the resort having stayed 4 nights last year with husband I came back for 5 nights with my mother. Overall, the staff are very friendly and accommodating so whilst the resort covers a big physical space, you feel like you could be in a friendly smaller run resort. I feel the experience of this hotel depends on the room. We had a room on the second floor of the main building close to the second inclinator. I couldn't stand the constant grinding of the inclinator and the resort moved us to a villa after the first night. The villas are in a quiet part of the resort and therefore much nicer to rest on the balcony so it is something to think about when booking a room and if you plan not too spend too much time in your room the inclinator wouldn't be an issue. I didn't want that background noise on my holiday when I live in a busy city! My mum had her second hip replacement earlier this year and was looking forward to resting at this resort. She loved it, found it very good for recovery and enjoyed the cleanliness of the pool. The resort offers fun daily activities to help pass the time and there are some really nice places to see in the local area. We enjoyed the food on the menu made from local foods and found the local warungs nice to break up the resort food. I have given it four stars because of the room issue which was resolved and because they haven't set up a proper spa area since the last time I visited. I believe a resort like this is missing out on business because they haven't finished their spa centre in the time the resort has been opened. Having said that, we did get two facials in the 5 days we were there but was looking forward to a pedicure as well, which they offered last year but won't have available they said for another month or two. I also really like the gym and where it is located in the resort.Overall, we would be happy to stay here again if we visit this area of Bali and feel we will next year as there is still so much to see and experience in this beautiful part of Bali. We hired a tourist driver from the local area to drive us to Ubud one day, it would be nice if the resort run a shuttle at least once a week like they do to the temple and I would have been happy to pay a small amount. Finally, they were using paper straws in my drinks which is a huge positive for me however the complimentary water bottles in the room are no longer in glass, but plastic. I feel it would be a nice touch to have these in glass as they must go through a lot of plastic this year.","October 1, 2018","13    Saranam Resort & Spa

The Villa is high up and steep, however it's nice villa and has amazing view. At night, outside the villa and path were very poor lighting.For 5-star hotel, the design of hanging space in wardrobe is weird (see pic).Good size bathroom but the amenities is not represent 5-star hotel.

763,"I just want to put a few of the negative comments on this forum into perspective , firstly you can always find fault with anything if you want to look for it , secondly you pay for want you get and sometimes you get value for your money and that is what I want to share with you. The Luxury Escape 5 night stay was in a quality room with balcony ,unlimited WI-FI , 42 channel TV with a large English content ,large bathroom , soft bed with a turn down service every night may I say, reading desk , safe , Tea / coffee and daily fresh fruit . Each day breakfast ,lunch , dinner served in 2 areas ( menus attached) , 4 massages , daily refill of mini bar ( beer , soft drink , sparkling water ), 6 free daily activities to choose from, a tour to Beratan Lake & Temple ,a coffee farm & a local market at a cost of AUS $10 for the 2 1/2 hour tour the resort also provided a drop off at the airport in a private car which is a 2 hour drive all the cost of $999 , that is value for money .The staff and manager were warm , friendly and helpful , spoke good English and genuinely cared for your well being , the resort is beautifully set out on the side of a hill with stunning views from your room and whilst eating in the restaurant , the food is of a high standard with a choice menu for lunch or dinner with the option of the buffet for dinner , the head chef even does an cooking actively. We celebrated our wedding anniversary I asked the staff where to purchase flowers they said leave it to us , later that night going for dinner they had set up a table, organised a menu ,special anniversary cake making the night very very special. Overall the negatives comments need to be balances with the many positives myself and other guests spoke with each other about . I would have no hesitation in returning to the Saranam Resort & Spa and will recommend to anyone, thank you Mr Alessandro Migliore and your staff for amking our stay so memorable .","September 14, 2018","13    Saranam Resort & Spa

764,"Looking on the pictures of the hotel, we thought we had found our next superb 5-star hotel in the nature of Bali. But except for the view, we didn't find anything from a 5* hotel. First of all, the greetings may happen in a gigantic room with a splendid view on the valley and mountains, it seriously lacked warmth and smiles from the staff for a hotel of this standing... For sure, we hadn't reserved a villa (which externally look really nice, I must admit), just a basic double bedroom for a one-night stay to decrease our driving time between two hotels. But after almost 10 minutes walking and waiting for the elevator to get to the room, we discovered that our room was extremely -extremely- humid and had the weird humid corresponding smell that didn't make us want to sleep in here. Some stains were seeable on the bed cover; the floor from the shower was partially broken in a corner and showed starting moisture; finally, sitting on the toilet let your knees only 10cm room with the facing wall - such unpleasant things can not be found in a regular 5* hotel, even in the most basic room. The restaurant was ok but the diner was pretty far from our expectations and corresponded far more to a 3* hotel - really, there is room for improvement. The breakfast was better. All in all, we wished we had skipped this hotel and gone directly to the next one in Kintamani. Definitely not what we expected.","September 10, 2018","13    Saranam Resort & Spa

The room was very clean and big, the mini bar which was free of charge was refilled every day. I agree the LE menus are limited but you do have the option to have a buffet dinner every night which always changed, and there are 4 or 5 options for each course on the set menu (plus there are two restaurants to choose from). The massages were AMAZING unfortunately there is no spa it is in a rather dingey hotel room, this would be my only improvement. Cannot fault the ladies doing the massage though. Happy hour every evening made cocktails etc affordable and there was always space by the pool (which is huge and refreshing). Aqua aerobics was hilarious can highly recommend.

766,"We did originally book a twin room and then was given a free upgrade to villa N°3. We were taken by buggy and could request it at any time. Although the rooms and villas are very tricky to get to as the inclinators (it’s like a lift) are very slow. It’s layout was incredible and the views of the rice paddi fields and the rest of the resort were amazing. But very unclean, the dust from beneath the beds and on worktops was vile! A tiny place under the stairs for wardrobe “space” and the mini bar was empty upon arrival and still wasn’t filled properly when asked! When housekeeping came everyday they would never take dirty cutlery from room service or used glasses from the night before. Speaking of room service -it’s average and extremely overpriced. You could eat in the local warung’s for 5 nights on the trot for the same price and same quality! Hotel is supposed to be for relaxation and for trips to the spa. The spa hasn’t even been finished built! And as for relaxation I do not appreciate falling asleep or waking up to techno or house music. As for the restaurant very basic, not worth the money. The steak was extremely thin not like a ribeye at all and the lamb had barely any meat on the bones, the burger was abit bland and I asked for medium not well done very disappointing. Although I did have a soft spot for the traditional desert ‘pissang goreng’ and because of that I ordered it the second night and it was just all slapped on to the plate. Considering a lot of staff do not speak a lot of English there was a lady called Carolina who could not do enough for you and spoke incredible English, her service was perfect Infact I could not fault Carolina as she was very warm and friendly. This hotel has EXTREME POTENTIAL. But I just don’t think anyone quite knows what there doing. This could be a dime spot but do not advertise as “relaxing resort and spa” when I’m being subjected to listen to cheesy pool party songs, if I wanted that I’d go to Benidorm!!!! Although Great things nearby -the waterfalls, unesco rice paddi fields, Local tea and coffee plantations and the floating temple. Highly recommend the trips!

768,"We stayed for 5 nights in the Hill Top Villa with the Luxury Escape package. The villa was nice but very basic, not a lot of room but a lovely 4 poster bed, no storage or hanging space. An electric kettle with no where to plug in and 2 cups is the only facility. Good size bathroom that was clean but not sparkling. Good hairdryer. When we had used the first shampoo and soap it was replenished with very budget plain packs. Great towels.We were in the top villa, very poor lighting up the hill path, none outside the villa. there is the golf carts to assist however these are unmanned so to avail yourself would have to go up the single inclinator, plus elevator then back to get a ride. The inclinator is a good idea however just like having a very slow lift (only one) for the whole large hotel.The food on the package is terrible... this was marketed as a health and wellness retreat! we had one menu, one page(see the photo) for lunch AND dinner for all 5 days! the chefs choice was often not available and many of the other dishes when asked were also not available. and the dining area so dark everyone was using cell phones to read menu and even see their food.There is no Spa!! this isn't a new hotel but the Spa hasn't been made yet??? go figure?? lovely ladies working out of a damp, smelling empty hotel room. Massage ladies devine... the only thing we were impressed with :) Jacuzzi doesn't work.There is absolutely zero entertainment in the evenings... the same repetitive sound track of instrumental sounds played all day and evening??? the restaurant at the top has no atmosphere and slow service... again the same set menu for the whole time!We were bored with the food, bored with the hotel. Very happy to leave. Don't recommend at all!!

769,"We arrived at the royal tulip saranam resort and spa and were very fortunate to be up graded to a villa but we had no hanging space except for a few shirt length articles and one drawer in the stair ( the other one did not open at all , so we lived out of our suitcases .) The views are spectacular every where you look ( a photographers dream ) so for that we were happy but for a resort that touted yoga and healthy eating as a draw card that’s where I truly think that they should not mention the word yoga as it is simply a small room with a few mats and as far as the healthy eating goes well it is truly a job in itself to find anything on the restricted luxury escapes menu that is super healthy , tasty or innovative ( some in fact I could not even eat and I hate wasting food ( one meal in particular I won’t forget was the pile of green peas ,chickpeas and carrots, no dressing with a few slices of corn cake . It was so bland and had no taste and I would say took no skill at all . ) Now I know that the manager Alessandro M . will reply to this by saying that we only paid a reduced special rate but I would counter that by saying that just because we were lucky enough to get that special deal doesn’t mean we don’t have access to the whole menus unless we pay for it as an extra . The meals were included in our deal why give us vouchers so we have the restricted menus and quite honestly felt like we were second class guests . Surely the special rate that we were lucky to get is an incentive for us to recommend you to other people . The gym has a damp smell that is caused from leaks coming from the roof that are obvious and the spa was not working whilst we were here as well as the inclinator that does not stop at number 2 door . We had probably the best massages we have ever had but the massage room ambience was lost when they had relocated that to an empty hotel room that smelt damp and dank and had a water leak on the floor ( towels were placed there to prevent clients from slipping ) Another negative was we were told at breakfast we could not be seated at a particular table because it was for 4 only but as we stood there another couple walked in to that table and sat down .........Another positive is the staff , they have been very attentive and always smiling so that was nice to see . We will sadly not be recommending any of our friends to this place as it was such a disappointment , it really is so easy to supply and offer great tasting food !!!","August 18, 2018","13    Saranam Resort & Spa

772,"We were so disappointed with this Luxury Escape trip. We spent 5 nights and were considering leaving earlier. The meals were terrible, cold and the same menu everyday. The rooms were damp, the staff friendly however communication with nearly all of them with the exception of a lovely waitress in the restaurant was difficult. The rooms were damp and smelly, the inclinator was very noisy and there was absolutely no information available on any tours or sightseeing. There was no courtesy bus to take you anywhere and the hotel arranged transport was very expensive. We survived the earthquake which was terrifying and the management was very disorganised with Hotel guests on the lower floors, not being notified that we were to evacuate. The scenery was pretty when the clouds cleared away, but it was freezing !!!!. Several activities were cancelled due to the weather and the overall cleanliness was poor. I was shocked that a supposedly 5 star hotel only had a two slice toaster in operation for breakfast, really !!!! get your act together but we certainly will never go back.","August 13, 2018","13    Saranam Resort & Spa

Earlier they had a different food menu for Luxury Escapes package but after few guest's complaints, they included everything in the dining menu. The staffs are helpful and always carries a smile on their face, although not fluent in English.The most notable part of our trip is the 7.0 scale earthquake that hit nearby Lombok island, the entire hotel was oscillating like crazy, all guests were scared, fortunately, no injury or damage was there!Overall, it is a nice resort for 2-3 nights stay, 5 nights stay sometimes feel boring as the resort is far away from most of the tourist attractions.

If you want a noisy activity heavy holiday this is NOT the place for you. I wanted to wind down with yoga and meditation, some cultural pursuits, massage and swimming. All of these were great though some days were too cool to swim. The outlook is beautiful, the trip to the temple and lake was great, close by, but too short. I should have asked for a day trip.

The hotel and pool area were quiet and relaxed, however they may have been too little sun beds for the amount of guests. Staff is very friendly and very much trying to accommodate in any need, however it is far from five star service. The rooms are spacious, but noisy, we were often woken by other guests in nearby rooms. The breakfast is terrible and requires a great deal of attention. There’s flies and other insects on the buffet, the bread was hard and the scrambled eggs tasted and looked like plastic. Overall prices are higher than in the rest of bali (let’s say 1,5 times the average). In case you are planning to stay at this hotel, don’t forget to book a taxi in advance, since it will take them up to an hour to get to the hotel (we ended up booking a private driver for 700k rp).","July 24, 2018","13    Saranam Resort & Spa

778,"We spent 4 nights here in a beautifully appointed mountain view room with amazing sweeping views of the valley and rice fields below from our balcony, bedroom and even bathroom. The day we checked in was extremely busy due to end of Ramadan and school holidays so the hotel was stretched to the limit and we had to wait until 4pm to get into our 2pm check in room.We were tired and there was no offer to compensate for our inconvenience (just a free drink in the bar would have helped) There seemed to be no plan in place to cater for such times including breakfast service. After that the rest of the days were quiet and things ran smoothly. Breakfast buffet was superb in a beautiful setting overlooking the gorgeous view. The coffee was fantastic! We ate in both their restaurants but were disappointed that we could not have Two Islands wine by the glass (as per the menu) When enquiring we found they did have bottles of such wine but they did not offer to open them for single pours.We suggested that we had a bottle with us to take to dinner but they came back that the corkage fee would cost as much as buying a bottle! The main restaurant, l'Altitude's menu was quite limited and expensive and we were surprised how empty it was for a hotel that was fully booked. The next night we tried the other restaurant, Toya,at the bottom of the complex reached by inclinator and found the menu very enticing and it delivered an excellent dinner - a beautifully presented Himalayan salt and pepper cured salmon with radish and wasabi, mains of chicken sous vide beautifully cooked and an innovative beef rendang. By this time they did have Two Islands wine by the glass - yay.Though we had a rocky start we really enjoyed our stay in the hills visiting the botanical gardens, market and Jatiluwih rice fields. We can recommend this resort and with a few minor adjustments we would have rated higher.","July 17, 2018","13    Saranam Resort & Spa

Candidasa itself is a 10-15 minute walk away, although lots of restaurants there will transport you if you want. It’s a quiet town, with plenty of great restaurants and dive centres . Aimed at 50-60 age groups. We took trips to nearby beaches, markets, gardens and palaces. Also did a boat trip to a good snorkelling location. We made friends with a local who showed us around his family farm and home. Typical of how kind and welcoming the Balinese people are. Wonderful hotel and a great holiday.

785,"If you were to come to Candidasa, but wanted to stay out of the busy tourist area, this is the place to be. Only 5 minutes away from the buzz, you find Puri Bagus with its beautiful garden and fine pool. The staff in the hotel is great, as they are very helpful and open to suggestions. The rooms are spacious and well maintained. Ours was a garden view deluxe room, but we could see a bit of the sea as well. Not that you’ll spend much time in your room though. You can chill out at the pool or at the gazebo’s on the seaside. There is no beach at this hotel, but the water in the pool is of perfect quality. Beach/Pool towels are provided at the pool for free. Next to the pool there is a small restaurant for lunch and dinner. Dining upstairs in the restaurant is also possible.Are there no downsides? Yes, unfortunately there are two. The hotel asks you not to consume anything you bring from outside the resort, on their premises. There is no shop on-site and the minibar menu is very limited. There are no bar snacks. We considered this a minus. On our first night we had an absolutely underwhelming dinner. The indonesian food on the menu is limited (mostly western, but the kitchen staff is Indonesian), and it seems the crew doesn’t master all dishes. We suggested to slim down the menu, and only serve amazing food that matches the surroundings. We hope management takes our suggestion into consideration. As of now, we decided to go off-site for dinner the remaining two nights. For that we ended up with Vincent’s in the town.Should you want to explore Candidasa, the hotel has two basic bikes available, which you can use if available. Nothing fancy, but good enough to save you the walk and have a nice look around. ","June 25, 2019","14    Puri Bagus Candidasa

787,"We stayed at the Puri Bagas for eight nights earlier this month.We were looking for a relaxing place to celebrate a significant birthday and definitely made the right choice.Our sea front bungalow was extremely comfortable, spacious and has an amazing ocean view.The outdoor bathroom was very nice with the only drawback being its proximity to the one next door.Breakfasts served in the upstairs restaurant were very good {either a la carte or buffet depending on the hotels level of occupancy) and the evening meals and cocktails we enjoyed at the poolside bar were also excellent.The location of the hotel directly on the beach and set in lovely well maintained gardens with a great swimming pool was ideal. The beach itself is not exceptional but is sheltered enough to swim safely in. Hopefully future restoration work will return it to the way it used to be.It only takes ten minutes to walk to the main street in Candidasa (a free shuttle service is also available) and there are plenty of good restaurants of varying prices to choose from as well as a reasonable number of shops.The biggest highlight of our stay however has to have been the amazing staff.The Manager, reception staff,room attendants,pool attendants,gardeners,restaurant and bar staff (including the lovely trainees) were all really welcoming and we were always greeted with friendly smiles. To be greeted at our door by a large contingent of staff songing Happy Birthday and presenting me with a nice birthday cake was a special and very nice surprise.We had a wonderful stay and hope to return.","May 20, 2019","14    Puri Bagus Candidasa

The food , including afternoon tea with pastries, was delicious as well as gluten-free for me. We ate most dinners at the resort overlooking the water listening to Balinese music. We took a guided trek through rice paddies and jungles and visited several traditional Balinese villages. Another day, a driver took us on a six hour trip to visit a floating palace, fishing villages and white sand beaches and in very good English told us about the culture, religion, education and economy of Bali.

In the beautiful restaurant, Sudiastari, oversees an delicious selection of Indonesian and Western foods. She and all of the restaurant staff are almost as fantastic as the view. I felt privileged to be their guest. My pre and young teen kids were treated respectfully and had an incredible experience exploring the grounds and hanging out at the pool. The cooking classes were excellent and really fun. (I’m a professional chef) Though I didn’t experience the yoga or spa, friends positively commented on their experience. As the sign in the room reminds your “Bali is not heaven...”. I wish the beach in front of the hotel were restored to its former state, and efforts are underway to restore the protective reef. When everyone hits the restaurant at the same time, there might be a wait. The facilities are not brand new but are very clean and well maintained.

The chefs and restaurant staff carefully guided me in each step in each dish. We prepared seven dishes and the result was first class. There was enough food for lunch and dinner and both were superb.

If any assistance was needed. the staff was very helpful in setting up transportation.Last, but certainly not least, the staff were incredible. Everyone we encountered were friendly, warm and very kind. We felt very welcome and well taken care of. Not a day passed when we didn't comment repeatedly on how nice the staff was.We stayed for a little over 3 weeks and never tired of this place. It was a wonderful place to stay.","November 29, 2018","14    Puri Bagus Candidasa

The rooms are sort of dark and beds are uncomfortable and hard. Nevertheless, staff is very attentive and we got an extra matress topper after mentioning the uncomfortable bed. The bathroom takes some time getting used to: It has an open roof and you here what exactly your neighbors are doing there.The garden, on the other hand, is wonderful! So is the pool.

We had a romantic dinner which also came with massages before dinner, and it was such a relaxing experience. Service staff were always smiling and happy to help us with whatever we needed.

813,"Once again I took my group to the amazing resort on the east coast of Bali. The group was surprised and thrilled by the beauty of the place to start with. The resort is tucked away down a lane off the main road where it is peaceful and quiet. We were greeted as if we were part of the family. Everything had already been set up so that our late arrival caused the least aggravation for our group who immediately were able to go to their rooms. Their luggage, which came before us, was already in the proper rooms. This was a blessing to the group who were very tired after a long journey from Flores having an extended delay in our flight to Bali. The breakfast left nothing to be desired. The selection of fruit, breads, and ethnic foods was extensive. A personal cook to made eggs as one desired. They were even brought to one's table. The lovely gardens outside the private villas entices guests to stroll and enjoy the flowers and plants. The property is flush with the ocean so that some people spent time on the bales (raised platforms with mattress and pillows covered by traditional palm fiber roofing) enjoying each other, the ocean, reading or meditating. In the afternoon, after we had toured, we swam in the crystal clear pool next to the ocean. Refreshments were close by and the pool staff was attentive. After a delicious dinner served on the lawn next to the ocean we were treated to a dance performance. One has the opportunity to ride in an outrigger canoe with eyes painted on the hull to the rocks beyond the surf. Locally this is close to many interesting sites of Balinese culture, Ujung (the water palace), the Amlapura Palace, Tirtaganga (water terrace gardens), Tenganan (the Bali Aga historic village), Klungkung Palace and the Kerta Gosa (Hall of Justice), Mt. Besakih Mother Temple, etc. It is nice to come back to such a welcoming place to spend the rest of the evening relaxing and enjoying friends.","October 9, 2018","14    Puri Bagus Candidasa

818,"First of all, I must say that, like everywhere else in Bali, the service we received here was exceptional. You feel like nothing is too much and there is always someone on hand to help. It's a well set out hotel, right on the coast. I won't say it's on the beach as there isn't much of a beach where the hotel is. The restaurant for breakfast is located on the second floor above the lobby and gives you stunning views out above the palm trees to the ocean. This made me look forward to getting up and going for breakfast which is a miracle!The food and drinks are good and reasonably priced as were the spa treatments. The only downside to the hotel was that the rooms and bathrooms felt a bit run down. There were no major issues but it just seems like the turnover of guests over the years has started to show. I don't think it would cost too much to re-tile where needed, update electronics etc so maybe this is something worth considering for the management as this is literally the only fault I can find with this hotel.","September 17, 2018","14    Puri Bagus Candidasa

Well managed, even during the earthquakes that were happening on Lombok, but also affected Candidasa. The food was good, rooms very spacious. We had no problem with insects in any of our rooms. I happen to love the outdoor style bathrooms, brilliant for that climate. The evening entertainment was great, good local band and delightful Balinese dancers. I do believe it's the best hotel in Candidasa. Awesome pool.","August 28, 2018","14    Puri Bagus Candidasa

820,"It's expensive for what you get. 10-20 years ago when the place and fittings were new, perhaps it was worth it, but now, it needs some serious renovation. You have all the facilities, and service is fine. But you can get all that for half the price or less in nearly resorts. My main negative, besides the price, is the electrics in the room. They did give me an extension, but it was still difficult to get things working. The outdoor shower is nice, but after a rainstorm, half the bathroom was wet (don't hand up you clothes if there is a danger of rain).","August 18, 2018","14    Puri Bagus Candidasa

At one point in the stay I had a health scare and the staff helped us to make phone calls and identify a local doctor for me to see. The rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable with big bathrooms which had baths as well as open to the air showers. There is a spa at which we all sampled a massage at very reasonable price (approx £16 for a 1 hour luxury massage). We enjoyed the Indonesian food here - accompanied by traditional Balinese dancing one night and for more international food there are other restaurants nearby (we would recommend Vincent's). This hotel is a great location to do diving and snorkelling from and a highlight for us was our trek up Mount Batur (with Tour Bali Driver).","August 8, 2018","14    Puri Bagus Candidasa

Not only the friendlyness of the staff, the excellent food and the fully ecquiped villa with great beds were a revelation.

828,"We just returned from a fantastic 10 nights vacation from Puri Bagus Candidasa and can highly recommend the hotel.Here are our impressions:Staff: Very friendly, hospitable and professional. Everyone greets you, even by name if you stay a little longer. They do everything to make you feel welcome. Plus if you have a request or are not happy with something, just tell them and they will fix it right away. They are simply the best!Hotel:It is wonderfully set in nature. The pictures on this site truly reflect reality. We were told that the resort is approximately thirty years old and that the rooms have been renovated three years ago. This means that this is not a contempary design hotel, which may be cool in trendy places, but would look odd in rural place like Candidasa. To us it looked like a very authentic hotel in the tropics where local materials and design elements were used. Details such as wood carvings on the beams of the roof that you could see from your bed, are so nice. Everything was clean. But don't forget Bali is in the tropics and Candidasa is a seaside resort (i.e. there may be a gecko in the room). Food and drinks:We were very happy with both. Breakfast has good choices, lunch and dinner offer many options. Since we really like indonesian food we were spoiled. Western cuisine is also available. They also do buffet evenings with entertainment such as legong or bands. To us, who live in Switzerland, the price level in the hotel was very reasonable. It all depends from your perspective. There are plenty of places outside the hotel were you can go for dinner and prices are even lower. But keep in mind that at the hotel you have a very nice view of the sea and a light refreshing breeze. How can you beat that?Pool:Nice, clean and no it is not olympic size but big enough to swim properly.Beach:Black lava sand, yes you can swim. Yes there a locals on the beach. Some of them may want to sell you boat rides or excursions but it was not bothering or intense during our stay. None of them approached us on the hotel ground.Diving:The dive shop ORCA was top and Gili Tepekong and Gili Mimpang (island and rocks right in front of the hotel) offered beautifuly corral reefs and fish. Amed and Tulamben are just 60 min. minibus ride away from the hotel and offer more beautiful dive spots.To sum it up Puri Bagus is a lovely, quiet, relaxing place with good food and most important very friendly staff.Terima kasih","May 20, 2018","14    Puri Bagus Candidasa

After staying in the busy areas of Abud & Seminyak, Candidasa was a nice mix of stores and restaurants with easy access to amazing mountain temples and snorkeling in Amed.

Everything about this hotel and the staff and the way they look after you is excellent. They put on a special dinner for us and the food and service was the best.

840,We recently were back at Puri Bagus and that was the second time this year because it is still our favorite place. Have travelled all over the world but we always come back to Puri Bagus.The location is very close to the village so you are able to get a feeling of real life on Bali. The rooms are spacious and in traditional Balinese style.The staff are the ones that make your stay so unforgettable.Have not stayed somewhere where their staff could compete with theirs.Hope this review will put Puri Bagus on your bucket list.,"January 23, 2018","14    Puri Bagus Candidasa

841,"We stayed here for 5 nights after returning from Lombok. Candidasa is a beautiful quiet little place, with lovely restaurants and a handful of bars and shops. The hotel is a 10 minute walk from the main road and is located right by the sea although there is not really a beach here. It feels very private and is extremely quiet. Staff are very helpful and friendly, especially the pool attendant who was always so happy and friendly.The rooms are decent sized with plenty of storage room and we had a sea front villa with fabulous views. Bathrooms are semi outdoor with open roof shower area. This was no problem for us however you can hear neighbors over the wall!! Only downside for us was breakfast. We opted for freshly cooked omelettes most mornings which were fine, however other food was laid out buffet style and was always cold and often empty trays. In such a quiet resort I think a small menu choice to be cooked freshly would be a huge improvement. Overall we would not hesitate to stay here again. We loved Candidasa as a resort and this hotel was a great find and very good value for money.","January 21, 2018","14    Puri Bagus Candidasa

842,"Puri Bagus Candidasa is a quaint traditional resort with villas set in a lovely garden setting, on the beach and serviced by very friendly and charming staff. The resort is associated with scuba diving and snorkeling with a good part of the swimming pool at 3.4 metres deep and the Orca Diving business right next door. To the left is a pleasant beach area with easy access to ocean swimming. The villa is large, clean and comfortable with an outdoor bathroom. Don't expect a large flat screen TV; you get an old 21"" CRT circa 1990's with limited channel selection. With a lovely outdoor aspect and glorious sunsets, why watch TV?I couldn't fault the food or the service provided by staff - both were excellent.The main road Jl Candidasa Raya is about 500 metres away along a narrow road with a nice and very new warung ""Mocka"" near the intersection. The elegant Vincent's restaurant is a little further south along the main road.Only a few gripes: Smoking is allowed in the restaurant Not enough shade around the pool, excluding the pavilions Ambiguous room rates - breakfast included/not included ( a minor detail but annoying)Bottom line: a great place for peace and quiet, great service and staff, a great place as a base to explore further north to Amed.

844,"Bali is overall costly location compared to many other locations in Indonesia, especially Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi. On top of it, the island is vastly and ghastly famous so the south if the island is always crowded. Travellers seeking tranquility venture to the north, particularly east of the island. So did we, after staying 3 nights at Nusa Dua. Puri Bagus may be the top property in Candidasa as per tripadvisor but my rating of three stars would be completely attributed to two points, views from the resort and the nature of staff. So, let me start from the star winning points.We checked-in on 12 Nov at room 102 which had seaview room. Marvelous setup it is. Sunrise is not directly viewed because the location is along the mountain on the side. This is east facing so sun sets in opposite side of the island. So you have a very subtle view of the changing colours of the sky. The rooms have verandah and along the seaside are beds with shades to relax the whole day. Ours was corner villa and the population in such resorts remain limited plus the villas are spaced out so you enjoy open spaces and fine views. Two out of three nights, the breeze was fantastic. Next is the staff. From e-mail coordination to pick-up from Nusa Dua to room service to bar service to restaurant service to spa services, the hospitality of the staff is very warm. They make you feel as their family guest. Always smiling, always happy to chat and serve. Very sublime gesture.Now translate that home and personal hospitality with the charges and rates. I am sorry but the infrastructure is old and not up to the international standards. Room has no safe which is ok but the almirah is rustic with paint worn off the sides of the wall. Beds and bedsheet are far below in standards and quality than what you get in a modern resorts. It rained on 13 Nov and the water seeped from the open bathroom side in the room all over the floor, luckily only near the almirah side. So the solution they came up was that multiple staff with their gamboots on are all over my bathroom and rooftop trying to detect and fix the problem. Again this is height of hospitality that I feel I am at their home so I have no privacy and they can spend their time trampling in my room and bathroom. I was shocked. In other resorts, the quickest options provided are change of rooms if there is such a leakage.Next is the provision of drinking water. The per day rate I paid was practically more than top resorts of Nusa Dua and all I am offered is literally 600 ml of drinking water for 2. You need more water, pay room service. I might have considered it norm of the land in Bali had I not stayed at Nusa Dua because there I had more than 2 litres of water per day complimentary.Food menu is limited but there are good restaurants on main road should you want to try more. Breakfast spread is again limited but more importantly when you know that it is hot and humid climate so flies are common and therefore you should cover all the items but unfortunately egg station at breakfast buffet had all cut items exposed to flies. Sorry but it ia unhygienic from all standards. From order perspective, food portions are big.Last but not the least, is the exposure to the local crowd. I think our corner villa was unfortunate in that sense. The nearby village crowd assembles in the morning and evening near the corner of the resort when they go for fishing and when they return at evening. So they is always noise of children and adults alike. And then when you are resting on one of the beds, you would be approached by local fisherman for sea activities, etc. This actually violates the definition of private beach for me. So this kind of exposure of privacy was disappointment for me.Overall, the value for money lead to loss of stars for me which I could have given to the resort. For this price, the management should seriously think to revamp the infrastructure to meet the quality standards of a four, if not five star resorts.Be advised that there is no white sandy beach per se. There is volcanic black sand and actually small dykes are built to keep off waves along the sealine. Local fishermen's boats are always parked there so there is little space for you to take the dip in the sea.","November 18, 2017","14    Puri Bagus Candidasa

846,"We recently returned to Rama for another visit and found it was even better than the last visits.A few small changes were delightful with lovely big lounges on the sand outside the Restaurant lovely to have a relaxed lunch on, although they do need back cushions.The soft furnishings in the rooms have been updated and this added a lovely bright color to our rooms.Pool towels are now placed on the daybeds and you no longer have to sign for towels, the white toweling covers on some daybeds were great and the new layout of the daybeds with some facing the ocean was a great idea.Loved the new Breakfast idea and as always the food was fantastic.We really enjoy the free activities and this trip we did the towel origami, the art class, the massage class, the yoga and the basket weaving. All these classes are outstanding with the hand picked local Balinese running the classes with all the love and care you get from these beautiful people. The staff at Rama seems to remain the same and I'm not surprised as they really are a caring and attentive team. I have been in Motel Management here in Australia and I could only hope my guests leave with the beautiful experience we had at Rama.I booked for a return visit before we left and yes we did have a small hiccup on checkin but the wonderful Manager and team more than made that up to us.Special mention to the Food and Beverage Manager, a lovely gentleman doing a fantastic job.Regards Julie ","October 16, 2017","14    Puri Bagus Candidasa

848,"We stayed here for six days and had a really good time in Puri Bagus. The rooms are very big and generally kept very well. Cleaning could perhaps be a bit better sometimes, but thats really a minor.Surroundings are fabulous with direct access to the beach, where you can go snorkeling right in front of the hotel (might be a bit rough in high tide and mind the boat traffic). Pool is also nice and clean and we never had problems about getting towels nor sunbeds. Breakfast is excellent and service here absolutely above average. Even when we decided to climp Mt. Batur and came back from the trip 10 minutes after closure, then we still got the opportunity to have breakfast. Wifi is generally working - not fast, but its working fine and should fulfill the need of a vacation in Bali.

851,"We stayed here because of the paragliding tour my husband was doing. They fly off the hill beside resort.First impressions were of a calm professional resort, we arrived later than expected because it took 2 1/2 hours queued up immigration at airport, ggrrrr, so we were tired and cranky on arrival but they made it pleasant and quick to check in.Bungalow is large and spacious, hard bed but ok. Only two pillows so I asked for two more, no problem.Bathroom at first glance is beautiful, partially outdoor shower is great. Then on closer inspection we noticed that it needs updating. Toilet seat is marked, not dirty though. Hairdryer is so old it seems dangerous. It gets very hot in my hand. Definitely needs renewing. Bathroom cabinet has a definite slope to it, needs propping up.The tv was old style and really really small. In 21st century there is no excuse for this type of tv.All staff were wonderful, nothing was a bother, everyone says hello. Especially liked young bar server, but can't remember his name, great smile.We were not harassed by hawkers on beach, once a day the boat drivers might ask if you wanted to go out.Short pleasant 10 min walk to Main Street.

This is a small town known for its diving and snorkelling. It is also a ferry terminal for Lombok and some of the other islands off Bali coast. This is an interesting place to park up for a couple of hours or so and explore the town. We later had lunch at the Hotel mentioned above.

There are lots of places to eat in Candidasa and we enjoyed every restaurant visit. The hotel is an easy 15 minute walk to town although restaurants provide a free taxi service if requested.

The rooms were fabulous, huge, plenty of storage space, lovely bathroom, i couldn't get enough of the shower (the novelty of an outdoor shower), and the bath products smelt divine. The beds were comfortable and the air conditioning excellent. The hotel itself was not too big and not too small, just right, and thankfully not too busy. we were greeting by friendly staff at all times and nothing was too much trouble. The pool was probably one of the most beautiful pools I've seen, very inviting and i found myself thinking back to it a lot upon my return home, stunning colour, brilliant depth, they hadn't gone overboard with chemicals (the last hotel I was at had so many chemicals in it that it was really painful to open your eyes). The food was delicious and my dad became obsessed with the crab soup from the restaurant by the pool, chicken lumpia were also divine. the cocktails, wow, the one in the coconut was by far the most entertaining one I've had and hysterical to receive. Definite cocktail envy by other guests on one night. The Spa looked great although I was somewhat put off by the prices, that being said, my partner had a massage and raved about it. The wifi I am also pleased to say was very good. I'm sure the setting was much nicer than the independent massage parlours down the road.

866,"It is the service that makes this place special. From the reception staff, to the pool attendant, restaurant staff and even the gardeners...always a smile and friendly and helpful service. The beautifully maintained grounds are an absolute credit to the staff. Obviously, this is a well-managed property and the management keeps the staff focused on exceptional service in a very competitive market. The room was super clean, comfortable and spacious. The pool was well maintained and a delight. There were enough sunbeds whilst we were there, but it could be tight if there was full occupancy. The breakfasts were good, although other food was somewhat ordinary. However, there are other places nearby that one can walk to or take advantage of pickup services. We had a very relaxing stay and highly recommend this property.","May 22, 2017","14    Puri Bagus Candidasa

The view is out of this world, the pool is heavenly, the food is delicious and the staff are so amazing. They put attention to detail into everything they do, and you can see the pride on their faces when they do something as simple as present you with a menu. The guy at the pool was so lovely! We did the snorkeling day trip and our guide, Made, made it very special for us. We also loved the area of Candidasa as it was not overrun with tourists and just had a generally magical feel to it.

The sunken bath provided the opportunity to relax further after a day out and about.We walked the streets in the surrounding area, purchasing a few items such as batik bags, shorts and dresses. MATAHARI store has a good supermarket, about a 15 minute walk from Poppies.Also we chose NORMIE BALI (see FACEBOOK) as our driver for 3 days to go to ULUWATU and SEMINYAK, UBUD for great silver jewellery, and MASON ELEPHANT SANCTUARY, just a little further north than Ubud.Next year's trip already to be booked!","May 21, 2019","15    Poppies Bali

877,"Despite operating for decades, Poppies Bali is a totally unique and great way to enjoy some quality accommodation, at an affordable price, within a step to the shops and other Kuta offerings. Literally an Oasis that we stay for the tai lend of every trip to Indonesia. We aren't tempted to do any shopping throughout our visit in the knowledge that this can be done once we check in to Poppies and that we can return to the accommodation if we get tired or simply overloaded with purchases. Staff are incredibly attentive and professional. Rack rate for the accommodation is very competitive and combined with very reasonable bar prices and an icy cold bar fridge that is provided empty to cater for self help options, absolutely perfect. Indeed the beer from the local super market was more expensive that buying one at the pool. Go figure. There is absolutely no noise from the busy Poppies lane and the restaurant is a few metres walk away. Free and quality airport transfers just make this a quality accommodation option.","May 12, 2019","15    Poppies Bali

As they just refill the bottles the next day...If 3 people are sharing the body lotion it really bcomes difficult to passon the bottle. Due to inconvenience n hygiene factor kindly provide extra toiletries to people on request. Secondly the milk provided with cornflakes and tea is hardly anything. So ps make sure the milk is more..We had these few issues but once i spoke to the manager they undetstood our needs and did try to make things easier.They took care of our airport transfer too.

885,"Love this hotel much at the moment I stepped into the hotel. The staff of receptionist and porter represented the unique Balinese hospitality. The cottage was assigned to me was numbered 31, not too far from the reception but very private. The cottage accommodated a terrace, compact dining/sitting area, bedroom and spacious open bathroom with a tiny Balinese Garden. Perfect. the amenities and facilities inside the cottage were almost excellent, lighting was great and power sockets were available throughout the space. But no slippers (lol). Every part of the cottage was well maintained (considering the compound was established decades back) and clean, very clean. I checked the pool (not have a chance to swin in) and it was really a mini lagoon, very pretty and relaxing. The other plus point was the garden in the compound, its pathway were well designed (Balinese), well paved and aesthetic. Even though the hotel was located in the busy area and small road of poppies lane in Kuta; the compound was very quiet and tranquile. To be in the compound filled me with the ambience of Balinese style resort in the 1990's. Other interesting things : 1. The food was good since they also have a fine dining Indonesia restaurant next door2. be prepared to bump into geckos and squirrels which are very common in Bali, (I'm personally bit nervous of facing these cute creatures) but they are harmless.Verdict: recommended","December 27, 2018","15    Poppies Bali

We didn't want to cause any problems so we decided to just sleep thru our last night, but we were woken up in the middle of the night by some weird noises for which we were sure it was a mouse.

895,"My partner and I stayed at Poppies recently for four nights. The one thing I have to praise highly is the beautiful grounds at Poppies, paths are dressed in colourful flowers and lush greenery, nothing short of a tropical oasis in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of Kuta. I also loved the pool area, very quiet and relaxing, surrounded by palms, bougainvillea flowers and white umbrellas- simply gorgeous! Aside from the grounds of the hotel my partner and I struggled with the rooms, we found them to be very dark, dated and small. I love the traditional look however strongly feel they need a renovation in order to help restore their beauty especially seeing they have been there for many, many years. The room also has an unusual smell due to the thatched roof which they tell you about when checking in, I understand it cannot be helped but just be ware. The bathroom was of a good size however did not like how the shower/bath are one, the shower floor was very old therefore wasn't inviting to have a bath at all. I definitely think the rooms could use some TLC to bring them back to life! The food at Poppies restaurant was great, very tasty and reasonable in price. A great choice also, very extensive menu offering both traditional food and american meals. If there I recommend trying one of their Mango Juices, super delicious! When staying at Poppies breakfast is included, you can request for it to be delivered to the room however I would recommend walking across to the restaurant as this way you will receive it hot and fresh, tried it in the room one morning but it wasn't great. Lastly the service, the staff are very friendly and lovely however I feel the service can be a little slow. Many times around the pool we had to go to them in order to place a drink or meal order, instead of them catering to those around the pool. I usually don't mind but noticed they were always standing under the hut doing nothing so couldn't understand why the couldn't come around the pool to guests and serve? Also organised to check out at 11am on our last day, however no one came to the room to help with luggage so found myself wheeling two large suitcases along the brick path myself- wasn't great as our room was the furthest from reception. Felt if they knew we were checking out they would send someone to offer help. Also passed many people who worked at Poppies while making my way to reception and not one person offered to lend a hand, was disappointing as they would have seen me struggling. Aside from the service and dated rooms I have still given Poppies a four star rating as I think value for money is great and the grounds are incredible, best I have seen in Bali after many years of visits. Poppies has great reviews on TripAdvisor but unfortunately this just wasn't the best place for my partner and myself therefore will not be staying at Poppies again, we will venture elsewhere.","September 25, 2018","15    Poppies Bali

896,"We had been to Poppies restaurant but had never stayed at Poppies Cottages so we decided to end up our stay in Bali with 2 nights at Poppies. What a good decision that was! The hotel is conveniently located near Jalan Legian and Jalan Pantai Kuta so is within walking distance of many bars and restaurants in Kuta as well as Beachwalk Mall. It is a bit tricky to find if you are coming by taxi as the lane is so narrow that taxis won't enter- we got dropped and had to walk the last bit to reach the hotel. Check-in was fast and efficient and we were shown to our villa (#24) which was lovely, surrounded by the beautiful gardens at Poppies, a riot of color and different sorts of plants and flowers. The villa itself was lovely with a beautiful terrace at the front with a table and chairs to sit and relax. The room was spacious with a large, comfortable bed, a writing desk and enough outlets for devices, a seating area and table and a nice flat-screen TV. The air-con was slightly problematic but we called the front desk and they sent someone immediately who fixed it. The indoor/outdoor bathroom was interesting and beautifully designed, a really nice feature of the villa.If you wander in the gardens you will eventually find yourself at the small but lovely pool which was never very busy during our stay. There is small bar and sitting area that has a lovely view of the pool and the surrounding vegetation. Also in the garden there are small sitting areas, a beautiful lotus pond, all of which make the gardens very appealing.The breakfast we had across the street in Poppies restaurant was excellent- a beautiful setting and the breakfast selection was great and the food delicious- a lovely way to start off the day! The hotel is just a couple of minutes' walk from Un's, one of Kuta's best restaurants where we enjoyed dinner one evening. It is also just a short walk to the Hard Rock Café and Jamie's Italian as well as a lot of fast food options, so a convenient base for visiting the local bars and restaurants. We walked up to Beachwalk Mall to see a film and have dinner one evening and it was very pleasant walking back when the temperatures were beautifully cool.We would definitely recommend Poppies if you want to stay in the heart Kuta. It is a very different sort of place to Seminyak but it is an excellent location for exploring south Bali and it is also very close to Ngurah Rai airport. The hotel will pick you up and take you to the airport, which is very convenient.I think that Poppies is probably more suitable for couples rather than families simply because it is such a small property; the staff all seemed very pleasant and helpful. Staying somewhere like Poppies is a very different from staying at one of the large resorts in Nusa Dua but it is such an iconic Balinese style hotel that has been offering wonderful accommodation for so many years, I would have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending Poppies to anyone coming to Bali and wanting to stay in the Kuta area.","September 11, 2018","15    Poppies Bali

There are little touches like leaving a local English written newspaper and some bananas on the porch table every morning that makes you feel like an honoured guest. Poppies is close to a number of restaurants as well as Kuta Beach is a short walk away.","July 21, 2018","15    Poppies Bali

900,"Love Poppies Cottages 1 Bali, we stayed here for 3 nights, they picked us up from the airport and quickly arrived at Poppies. Walked into the grounds and was very surprised of the hidden gem behind the stone walls. We were welcomed with a fresh tropical drink then we strolled through the lush gardens to our beautiful cottage. The cottages were large and roomy, window seats with table. The shower and toilet were outside in a covered area with gardens and stones. Loved the outdoor bathroom. Cute balcony to sit on whilst we waited for our kids. The pool was only small there isn't a bar if that is the type of thing you like. The Grounds are very quiet considering it is surrounded by busy streets. Step outside the walls of Poppies Cottages and you are on Poppies Lane which has lots of bars and restaurants close by. Walk to the end of Poppies Lane to the right and you end up on Legian Street go to the left and a short walk to the beach. The staff were lovely and friendly. We didn't get breakfast included as we wanted to try a few smoothie bowl places. They offered us a free transfer to our next hotel which at the Grand Inna which was really helpful since the Grand Inna wouldn't help us out (see review for Grand Inna) Poppies Cottages I highly recommend we had a great stay and would definitely stay there again. Wish we had booked longer.","July 19, 2018","15    Poppies Bali

903,"there are two Poppies hotels in Kuta. We had a private bungalow which was decorated in traditional Balinese decor with pitched thatched roofs and great air conditioning. The grounds and pools were really nice as it provided an element of serenity which I did not expect as Kuta is very busy and lively, but inside the compound, it was quiet and relaxing. Room service was fast and the dinner meals we had were wonderfully tasty. I am Dutch Indonesian and I have always been aware of good Indonesian food so I speak from experience. Having said this, this hotel is a pit stop for us either before we start our Balinese trek around the Island or when we are about to go home. I never spend more than two nights here, because if you really want to experience Bali, Kuta is not the place to do it.","June 27, 2018","15    Poppies Bali

Beautiful bungalows with an outdoor shower, toiletries and hairdryer are available and there is also tea and coffee and 2 bottles of water every day. there is an outdoor terrace at each bungalow and if you do not have breakfast in the restaurant, they deliver it and cover the table on your own terrace. Breakfast is very good, you can order everything separately and there is something for everyone. Poppies has a beautiful swimming pool to cool down when you return in the afternoon. And there is a pool bar. It is a quiet hotel, it is not a hotel for children, who may come there, but the pool and stuff is not for children to play. There is a free shuttle service to and from the airport. They also arrange a scooter if you want to rent it.Poppies is located in the middle of Kuta and as soon as you walk out of the doors you stand in the bustle of it.All the staff do their best and are extremely friendly and helpful.We have not been able to discover any negatives.

The checkin was easy and we were taken to our cottage through the impeccable and beautiful garden. The cottage was beautiful, which included outside seats and table in the porch, entering inside the cottage there was a king side bed with crisp white linen. A good size tv with dvd player discreetly installed in the wardrobe. Dining table and couch., fridge and coffee makibg facilities. As well as the air con there was also a ceiling fan. We could not gave wanted for more. The bathroom which leads from the bedroom is partially outdoor and massive, again very well equipped, especially enjoyed the sinken marble bath.  When we returned each evening the beds had been turned down and frangipani flowers placed on yhe sheet, also electric mosquitto replellant had been plugged in. Also a mosquitto coil had been lit outside. Each evening we hung our breakfast request on the door which had a large bbc aried selection which was delivered promptly to our room at our requested time each morning. The breakfast was of a very high quality and coild not be faulted.The swimming pool was inceedible, very well designed and the mature plants and trees thar surrounded it just increased its appeal, also there was a spa which was very relaxing after a day of shopping. The pool was serviced by a small bar which also served food from the poppies restaurant.It was to imagine that we metres from poppies lane as there was so little noise.We definatley will not stop anywhere else again, this has everything you could want and more.. thankyou for a memorable trip and see you again","May 31, 2018","15    Poppies Bali

I've stayed in the cottages for over 30 yrs and would again - with its lush plantings and Balinese antiques, spacious if now classic and a bit dated cottages, exceedingly evocative and pleasant pool & bar as well as smiling and accommodating staff, it is great value. Breakfast is included - generous, delicious, and very pleasant in the hotel's restaurant across the 'gang' from the cottages. The only drawback is ... Kuta.

908,"Paradise in the heart of Kuta, situated on poppies lane 1, behind the stone wall are old style bungalows . Beautifully situated amongst lush gardens , each cottage has its own privacy. Inside is just gorgeous , wonderful comfy bed, a small table & nook where you can read, eat, or just play a game of cards . All windows have flys screens, in room safe , tea and coffee making, outside bathroom with shower which can be transformed into a bath . Great storage space for clothes . Smart tv and wifi. Breakfast can be bought to the cottage every morning or eaten at poppies restaurant .breakfast is basic but plentiful , coffee is awesome . It has cold aircon and also a ceiling fan. One concept we thought was great was the fridge and shopping facility, you ring number 3 and they will do your minimart shopping , stocking the fridge with Bintang , water , whatever you need . Saves carrying those huge water bottles back to the bungalow. Water pressure could be harder but it was hot. Pool area is beautiful, and comes separately with a spa near it ( we used the spa quite a bit) , pool is very private .Only annoying thing is the RUDE PEOPLE that constantly put towels on pool chairs and then go away for more than a hour. Now hear this GUESTS the pool area is for all guests and you are rude putting your towel there stopping anyone else from enjoying the space . Get a villa if it’s a private pool you want . I think staff need to take towels off the lounges if the guests have left them more than 1 hour . Poppies lane 1 can be annoying with motorbikes and cars , be careful stepping out of the gate into the lane . It’s in a great spot / area of Bali close to shopping and great food also the beach . It traditional and we love that , it’s the tri Bali let’s hope they remain that way forever .","April 18, 2018","15    Poppies Bali

909,"This was our fifth stay at Poppies and it's become a home away from home for us. We stayed 6 nights including Nyepi, the Balinese day of silence. The cottages have had some minor changes since we last stayed, new toilet, shower fixtures and wifi connection is now through the new smart TV. One other change is that they no longer leave black tea outside your room in the early morning, I understand many probably don't it, but we always enjoyed having our tea in bed, and it was such a small tradition from the past I'm sad to see it's gone. Other than these minor changes Poppies remains an oasis of quiet, calm and beauty in the madness of Kuta. Nyepi was extraordinary, so quiet and the night so dark I've never seen so many stars. If you are looking for a traditional and beautiful small hotel in Kuta then Poppies should be top of your list.","March 27, 2018","15    Poppies Bali

910,"I have been visiting Bali and staying at Poppies Cottages for some twenty years now. Unfortunately, the time since my last visit has been about three years, much too long. Poppies gets better and better. Once inside you will be welcomed by very courteous and friendly staff. The entire property is all lush and green, with many flowers, trees and garden areas. There is a swimming pool and several fish ponds. The whole place attracts many kinds of birds and there are many opportunities if you are a photographer. The cottages are really special, in traditional Bali style with thatched roofs, marble and dark wood furnishings and large, comfortable beds. The bathroom area has a sunken bath which is very relaxing. The veranda is a perfect place to sit and relax, and the cottages are arranged for a good level of privacy. Kuta is a very crazy place, and Poppies is a real and welcome oasis to escape to from the surrounding madness. I would never stay at any other place in the Kuta area, and I hope to make many more visits to Poppies in the future.","March 24, 2018","15    Poppies Bali

Included in this package was a one hour massage which you can choose to have either at the pool side or in the privacy and air-conditioned comfort of your room. Also included in this package was a Rijsttafel dinner at Poppies Restaurant or you can also choose to have it in your room, which I did and what a delicious treat it was. Sadly I was not able to eat it all but it was a great way to have a little taste of everything I enjoy about Balinese cuisine.This was my 4th visit to Poppies and it was as beautiful as ever... the room, the gardens, the pool and of course each and everyone of its staff was simply outstanding. I also got to spend a little more time with their beautiful resident puppy, ""Barong"" which was really nice.Thank you so much Poppies for your warm and friendly hospitality and I hope to see you again soon.

Lovely breakfast and excellent staff along with quality comfortable beds. Our air-con broke down and was fixed within hours, they had someone on site who could take it apart, diagnose the problem and replace an electronic component. Not an easy task, such expertise in a small hotel. Although not a modern hotel everything was maintained to high standards, quite an achievement when they are not charging Shangri-La or Manderin Oriental prices.

The bathrooms are spacious and well maintained. The air conditioning is excellent and there is a safe in the room. The beds are very comfortable as well. The pool is big and good enough for some laps. My only complaint is the Bloody Mary which we ordered at the pool bar. The pricing and the drink which eventually came by just does not match.

My cottage #31 was next to the wall, but you did not even notice the noise from the outside lane. The cottage was beautiful in Balinese style. The room had a refrigerator (good for my beer), wash clothes (it amazes me how many nice hotels do not provide them), safe, robes, umbrella, etc. I love the bathroom with part of it open on the top (true Balinese style). I read where one person complained that birds were noisy in the morning (stupid). I did notice the birds in the morning, but it made you feel you are one with nature. As for the staff (I stayed 8 nights), what can I say but ""Outstanding"". At the end of my stay, I consider some of them as my friend, and I am Facebook friends with them. They would recommend places for me to go and tell me places I should not go that were overpriced and gave a bule (foreigner) price. All their recommendation were spot on. The breakfast was excellent served on your front porch of your cottage. It came from Poppies Restaurant which serves excellent food (ate there one night). The pool was small but nice and secluded and did not have the boring chain hotel look. It blending perfectly into the garden surroundings with a natural stone look. Would I recommend this place. Let's say, I would not stay anywhere else in Kuta, except here.

934,"We were thrilled when we were taken to our room at Bali Santi.We were in the Courtney Love Suite or #11 which had a sea view.The room was mazing with your own fully serviced kitchen with full sized fridge.Massive semi outdoor bathroom.TV,Kettle,Beanbags for the pool,infinity pool and the restaurant was right next door to us.We just sat on our verandah and watched the sea.We had our own spa too but we only used that once.Food at the restaurant was good and reasonably priced.Ice cold beers and cool drinks.You can only walk a small distance along the beach at low tide and swimming was good.No snorkelling.You were just outside of town but close enough to still walk in.Outside the hotel there are rice fields and a couple of restaurants if you dont want to eat in the hotel.Im not sure if they had a courtesy vehicle to take you into town or not as we just walked.Everything about this place was perfect for us.You can have cheaper rooms with perhaps more privacy but we had a chat with everyone as they went past.Cant help ourselves","December 10, 2018","16    Bali Santi-Bungalows By The Beach

935,"The Bali Santi Bungalows is a small property on the beach with a small swimming pool and restaurant. The bungalows were clean with outside bathrooms, they had tvs and video machines so you can play any DVDs you have bought. The staff were friendly and the hotel reception helpful with any requests. This place is not 5 star but was comfortable and quiet and reasonably priced, nice for some real rest and relaxation. The town is about 15 minuets away and the hotel offers car service to town for a few dollars which can be useful if raining or very hot.","September 22, 2018","16    Bali Santi-Bungalows By The Beach

937,"We stayed here 18 months ago and while the place is still very good you can see signs that is may not be being maintained as well as it could be.That aside the pool is great and it is great to see that you can now swim out the front. Last time the tides were far to high.We booked a sea view room and while it is great as it is very close to the pool the down side is it is next to the restaurant so what ever they are cooking you can smell in the bathroom and sometimes in the room itself.Additionally the staff are quite noisy when they start work around 6am making a sleep in impossible.If booking Seaview room, ask for room 1 as it is on the other side and not likely to be impacted by smell and noise.The wifi however is really really really poor. Last time we had not issues.Unfortunately many of the other guests were very selfish hogging day beds even though they weren’t using them or the pool leaving other guests who wanted them not able to use them","September 8, 2018","16    Bali Santi-Bungalows By The Beach

The pond was filled with fish and surprisingly there were also two turtles swimming around in the pond. The area around the bungalows is beautifully green and there is a lot of vegatation.

952,"Firstly thank you to Bali Santi for laying out HAPPY BIRTHDAY on the floor of our suite in flower petals. It was such a lovely surprise gesture, since we were saying on my 40th birthday.The hotel grounds, gardens, pools and rooms are gorgeous. I could have definitely stayed longer than 1 night, although I’m not sure the simple breakfast would excite me for too long. The suite was large, light and airy and served us well. There is some obvious wear and tear but it doesn’t affect the function of the room. The only issue we had was the extra bed that we’d paid an extra $28AUD for. It was just a mattress on the floor with a stained bedspread. We tried not to look too closely at the brown blob and stain on the bedspread, but it did look suspiciously like rat poo. Despite the extra bed, we enjoyed our stay.","October 23, 2017","16    Bali Santi-Bungalows By The Beach

We had orange juice, omelette and bacon plus toast and jam and all the tea and coffee you desire.Our room (suite) had a 4 poster bed complete with a mosquito net which was not used.

957,"This is the first review I've written where every single thing about the accommodation was perfect! We were in Viewbay rm 14, one bungalow back from being beachfront and think it had been recently renovated coz it seemed brand new! Lots of space, large comfy four-poster bed, TV (limited channel choices however), mini kitchen, large outdoor bathroom with good hot water and pressure, balcony with seating and oh that ocean view. Plus the little things such as: shampoo/conditioner, soaps, lots of hangers, safe, twin vanities, lots of shelf space, drying rack. No issues with plumbing or aircon or electrics. Wifi worked well outside, but a bit dodgy inside the room. Pool towels were provided direct to each room along with bath towels; however could've done with a hand towel, and could do with suitcase rack. Breakfast was included and was a simple menu, but adequate and always nice, served in the ocean front restaurant, which was open all day for meals/drinks, with ++taxes. Small Bintangs were Rp25,000, cocktail happy hour was 7-8pm with limited choices. The beachfront infinity pool was inviting, but a bit cold, with limited sun beds yet no problem with acquiring one. Bali Santi has about 19 bungalows angled to face the ocean, each with a verandah. There is also a private 2 room villa and a honeymoon suite. The location is walkable to the main eateries of which there are plenty, and candidasa is such that you don't get hassled to the point of frustration by hawkers. And Ketut from the spa charged Rp100,000 for a massage.There's no blue birds (local taxis) but lots of drivers, or hire a scooter to get about. The hotel has its own vehicles and charged Rp450,000 for airport pick up which is quite reasonable - we found a driver that did it for Rp350,000; and another for Rp400,000. With no traffic hiccups, roadworks or processions, the trip takes about hour-and-a-half.","August 27, 2017","16    Bali Santi-Bungalows By The Beach

The rooms are clean and have everything that you need including a TV and DVD player. Short 10 mins to town plus plenty of places eat even nearer and good food from the street carts.

960,"This place was recommended to us and we understood why. Small, quiet, reasonable and clean with a great staff. Had a Seaview bungalow which was close to the pool and restaurant. About 8 sun chairs beside the small pool and others on other side of the restaurant. Had a small area for massage- great not having to go far to get one- and in open air, with just light curtains and the sound of water falling.We sat at the restaurant overlooking the sea most evenings enjoying the sunset.We ate there one evening and the food was good and well priced. So convenient.Had lunch by the pool one day- just 6 m from the restaurant do easy to get food and drink as you laze. Room was fine, a little older but great value for money. Lovely open air bathroom but had a glass door between this and the main room so while it was still relatively private it may not suit everyone. Enjoyed sitting on the verandah outside enjoying the breeze. Laundry service was very reasonable ( cheap) and we used their driver for a half day trip one day. Staff very accommodating.Free Wifi was spasmodic but that is common in BaliThere is a coffee shop - Loaf - just across the road and it is a short walk to a number of restaurants, shops and Alpha Marts. We enjoyed the quiet of this place, not big or commercial just real Bali.","July 1, 2017","16    Bali Santi-Bungalows By The Beach

Just a small inconvenience. The restaurant on the water and right beside the infinity pool is pretty amazing. Food is good and staff very friendly and helpful.The location is right across from rice paddies though the neighbourhood is quite simple - a village with several storefronts, diving providers and quite a selection of restaurants within walking distance - once you are used to walking in Bali !One of our very favourites !","May 29, 2017","16    Bali Santi-Bungalows By The Beach

Breakfast was good, with a choice of eggs and bacon or sausage, pancake, or just toast, along with coffee and juice or fruit. The staff was always pleasant, and our room was serviced daily.

You can easily walk to many bars and restaurants outside the property and there are some great places to get a massage nearby.The only couple of thing I would change are the pillows that are just too high (I used the pillow from the couch) and the mattress is very hard.I would definitely book here again","May 5, 2017","16    Bali Santi-Bungalows By The Beach

968,"Balisanti Bungalows is hidden gem in quiet town of Candidates. If you want relaxing stay with sounds of ocean and birds, free roaming chicken, cute and hungry cats it's a place for your.I stayed in beach front bungalow with private pool. As mentioned here before, there's no actual beach at Balisanti ( couple of nice beaches close by and hotel provides transfer) but the view from restaurant and infinity pool is nevertheless stunning. Staff is always friendly, smiling and helpful (as pretty much everyone else in Bali). Breakfast was included in price, dinner was extra. I had dinner in Balisanti almost every day of my stay, food was delicious and prices reasonable. If you want to tour around Bali, then Candidates is bit too much ""out of the way"". There are some local tour organisers (you can also book through hotel) but selection is better in Kuta, Denpansar or Ubud area and prices also bit lower.Couple of things to whine about: Bungalows are bit too close together, so not much privacy unless you close all the curtains; breakfast was bit inconsistent, some days fruit platter arrived before main, some days together with main, some days after and quantity of fruit also varied, some days additional cup of coffee was free, some days it cost extra.","April 20, 2017","16    Bali Santi-Bungalows By The Beach

969,"I came to Candidasa purely for some rest and relaxation, and that's exactly what I got.My bungalow was huge, with a mini kitchen, an outdoor bathroom and a front porch with a recliner that was perfect for lounging about on when I wasn't down by the pool.The pool is small but there weren't that many guests so it wasn't an issue. The restaurant next to the pool served decent fair at reasonable prices, and most of the time I ate here because it was convenient.All in all I was very happy at Bali Santi and will return again. I felt it was great value for money and enabled me to relax and have a well-earned break. The only things I would change was a) the pillows - all 4 were very high, so I had to resort to using one of the cushions off the sofa and b) my room was set well back from the restaurant and it was difficult getting wifi coverage, so I had to move down to the restaurant when I wanted to use this.","April 17, 2017","16    Bali Santi-Bungalows By The Beach

We stayed in bungalow with sea view, just next to restaurant, a great place to spend the night. Wifi is good enough, and they have direct access to the beach, that we can enjoy the beach just few steps away. Hope there is another change to get back here with more nights...","March 15, 2017","16    Bali Santi-Bungalows By The Beach

972,Originally we were book for 5 nights but due to family commitments we could only have 3. Sadly. We checked in late at night so couldn't see what was all around us but woke up to a little peace of heaven. For everyone that goes to mainstream Bali this is the total opposite. A little oasis on the edge of the ocean. We booked an ocean view bungalow and we literally 10 steps away from the infinity pool and the ocean. The restaurant / bar area is on the water and the staff are so very welcoming. Breakfast was included and there was a choice of 3 items with fresh fruit and fresh juices. Just perfect. Our bungalow had an outdoor bathroom which was just something so different and lovely. There are a few local restaurants which will pick you up but the food at the restaurant was lovely and so reasonable. We can't wait to go back. ,"February 17, 2017","16    Bali Santi-Bungalows By The Beach

976,A lovely property with some superb bungalows and friendly staff.The first suite that they put us in was spacious with a nice fish pond in the bathroom with a fountain but didn't have a tub and had dirty toilet seat cover. Everything else was nice but we wanted the tub so they changed our suite. It was a little smaller but the bathroom was awesome and with clean toilet. It also had an outdoor fountain which seemed like it was the bungalows private one.Their welcome drink was so fresh and filling. The sea side pool next to the restaurant is nice but unfortunately we didn't have the time to enjoy it. On the other side they have sun beds and a bbq. We enjoyed a nightcap there.They arranged a nice new bike for us to get around. Breakfast was plenty and delicious.Only problem - You can hear insects/bird all through the night making it difficult for light sleepers like me.

978,"When I checked out Bali Santi on the internet it looked great. It was actually better than I expected. The room was a great size with plenty of storage for all of our stuff, it was the beginning of a month long stay in Indonesia. The bathroom was massive and beautiful with gorgeous natural light. We had the bungalow behind the restaurant that had its own little plunge pool, which was awesome. The bungalow had a kitchen so we could have some of our duty free at our fingertips. The staff here are just lovely and happy to help. If you want a massage, you can't go past Ketut, she is amazing with such beautifully soft hands. I have a huge soft spot for Candidasa as it's on the seaside and it's pretty quiet. We have been coming here for 18 years and can't imagine going to Indo without a stop in Candidasa.

982,"We decided to have a pink tour through the different PinkCoco hotels after getting recomendations from friends and surely after reading the amazing on line comments.We directly contacted the hotels to get a better deal for our stay with a free upgrade and lower price.We started in Bali which we enjoyed so much in the Penthouse with an amazing sunset view from the top.The hotel is cozy and we loved the adults only pool where the staff provided free flavored water and free snacks everyday. Later we realized that's common in all Pinkcoco hotels , same as they do evening turn down with free nite-cookies and scented oil burners.Are these hotels really three star rated? From Bali we stayed in Gili Air and if Bali was great , this was wow !No words can describe the emotion of swimming at night under the moon , the superb staff service and the unique sunset experience sipping a Mojito while swinging in the famous pink swing.Lastly , we wanted to have some fun, we stayed at the property in Gili T where the party normally goes on until late at night with a chilled atmosphere with a funky crowd .The sunset was even better than in Gili Air and we considered ourselves so fortunate for having decided this pink tour that we will definitely do again.Thanks to all, Deli, Putu, Stefano, Lalu, Jojo and Made.We love you guys.

986,"The Pinkcoco is a wonderful and very 'homey' hotel that is nicely appointed, very quiet and relaxing. We stayed as a family with our six year old and she loved it - especially the pool and free wifi! The Pinkcoco is in a great spot, just 200m walk from the gorgeous Padang-Padang beach which is a safe for swimming (lifeguard) has rock caves to explore and comes complete with a host of cheeky monkeys. Surfing and stand-up paddle boarding lessons are also available. There are plenty of great eating places on the nearby strip, but you can't go past the in-house Italian restaurant 'Trattoria' which has an enormous range of well-priced food and have super-awesome staff. I can't recommend the place highly enough. It's also close enough to get to cool tourist spots such as Ulawatu Temple - we hired a Grab (download the Grab app) for 4 hours for AU$27 and the driver dropped us, helped get tickets and brought us home (don't get a Grab one way and expect to get one to pick you up as there will be about 500-800 tourists also waiting!)","May 18, 2019","17    PinkCoco Bali

Also after the room was cleaned there was this really persistent smell of sewage, my girlfriend just thought it was incense but I found the smell absolutely nauseating (maybe it is just me). The pools were nice and big. Breakfast is included if you have a booking.com genius status. Breakfast was very good, especially the eggs benedict. Be aware there are monkeys near the hotel, we had one on our balcony so remember to keep your balcony door closed when you are not in your room.Do not get your clothes washed at the hotel itself. I explicitly asked that they wash my clothes only with cold water, but they did not and some of my clothes were ruined. I did not have to pay for the wash service, but I would have expected more compensation. Scooters were on the expensive side if you rent them for one day (100.000IDR) and do not include fuel. Also this is the only place on our trip where they checked the scooters for damage, so make pictures before you sign the rental agreement.","November 25, 2018","17    PinkCoco Bali

They also paid attention to every tiny details like providing hairbands in the bathroom. Everything was in pink. The pool was amazing also. We swam in the evening, the water was warm and clean. Padang Padang beach is just 2 minutes walk from the hotel. The only downside was the loud live music from the cafe nearby. But the music was pretty good though, for us it wasn't really disturbing. For those of you who wants a quiet, peaceful night, make sure to choose a room in the back or near the pool so that the music didn't disturb you that much.

1002,"I stayed with my boyfriend in Pinkcoco Bali after reading so many good comments in TA, and so lucky we chose it .This is a quaint hotel very well designed with ample rooms if you take a Horizon room type and very nice semi open bathrooms too.I love the shower which is a lava stone and the water runs like a waterfall. Very original touch and great feeling to be under a waterfall.This little hotel has 3 pools , one only for adults which we appreciate a lot. But what is out of this world is the level of service and touches . From the check in with nice cold towels , iced tea and a pink bracelet of course.During the day they pass around fruits skewers around the pool and they provide free fruit water .All th staff are amazing with always a sincere smile on their face . Thanks Tini and Desy for all your help.The room is cleaned twice a day and at night they put an aroma scented oil in the room, a mosquitoe set though we did not feel any mosquitoe during this time of the year, actually at night may be chilly .The pity is that the hotel does not manage their restaurant though seems to be next year they will take over . Nothing wrong with the restaurant but too Italian for everyday meal . Would have wanted a more international food but the dishes that I ate were tasty.The hotel is just walking distance from the beach and there are many other places around to eat and drink.I personally like Horizon 13 which is the biggest room they have. The price was fair for the high season but I would not save a few dollars looking for something cheaper as this hotel is managed very profesionally. We booked direct and they gave us a special price. We wanted to visit their hotel in Gili T but they told us is closed for some renovation after the earthquake they had on August 5 but we will go for sure next time .  There is an independent spa at the back of the hotel and I was very happy with the service . Price was quite reasonable for the month of August when everywhere is full . Remember to book in advance .So very recommendable and pretty hotel. I luv it !","August 28, 2018","17    PinkCoco Bali

1005,"Was originally booked for Pinkcoco Gili T, however due to high seas was unable to make it across to Gili T. Was booked through one of Expedias brands and was ready to accept defeat and find alternative accommodation in Bali for the time we were meant to be on Gili. However a friend recommended I call the hotel to see if they could rebook me to a later date. Ended up speaking to Meiki who was fantastic, super helpful and accommodating. Originally was able to move my dates at Pinkcoco Gili T to a few nights later however upon further investigation into the ferries it was apparent we weren't guaranteed to get across. Decided to ask Meiki if we could stay at Pinkcoco Bali instead, and upon a bit of checking we were told we could!Spoke with Made who was 10/10 in his service and hospitality. Due to availability issues we had to move rooms during our stay but we were very appreciative they were able to accommodate us at all so it wasnt a big deal at all.Rooms were massive, with very comfortable beds. I'd say the decor was very romantic however would suit families and groups too. Pools were awesome, and the setting was very laid back. Just what we needed after escaping the main tourist areas of Kuta and Seminyak. Wasn't a major fan of Padang Padang beach but the hotel is well situated for exploring the southern tip of the island, and is handy to must do's such as Single Fin and El Kabron.Overall thoroughly enjoyed my stay there. Definitely try Mango Tree for lunch and Beetroot Bali for brekkie, both 2 mins walk from the hotel.","July 29, 2018","17    PinkCoco Bali

When I mentioned it the next morning the staff was extremely apologetic and ensured my room was deep cleaned on the day.

The staff are super friendly and willing to assist with anything. I arrived after a 3 hour drive really hungover and they were kind to offer drinks and water haha There is an Italian restaurant attached and although it's not part of the hotel so need to pay at the end of each meal. Reasonably priced and good food. We were probably given the worst room they had as it was tucked in the corner of a courtyard so quite dingy but it was still totally fine. There are 2 pool areas, 1 which is adults only and always really peaceful, my husband spent a whole day here on his own whilst I was out. Few little bars and restaurants within walking distance and it was reasonably priced, so for me it ticked all the boxes.","May 8, 2018","17    PinkCoco Bali

I found out from the lady who owns Can Chill Warung next door that PinkCoco was the only spot in town for many years. The community has grown up around PinkCoco and that suits the place really well as the staff goes out of their way to make you feel at home. We really appreciated their genuine kindness and willingness to help us with everything we needed. Just a short walk to Padang Padang and a healthy 1.5 mile trek to Uluwatu. I did it every morning with board in hand at age 47, needless to say I was warmed up for my surf when I arrived. They also didn’t know we were brining our 9 month old since we booked through Expedia, and as soon as we arrived the upgraded us because we had a baby.

1019,"No hesitation in recommending this place; great pools and clean spacious rooms. We booked the 360 view room which was great. The location isn't too central so it would be best if you can ride a scooter. Taxis are overpriced so you need to get the bluebird taxi app but for that you need an indonesian sim card. We couldn't get a taxi from single fin around 7:30pm so had to get a ""local taxi"" that charged 50k (down from 100k) for a 3 minute ride. Mango tree is a good restaurant nearby, very friendly staff and reasonably priced. Finally, Pinkcoco wouldn't be what it is without two very special ladies; Toni and Ventry. Hopefully the management read these reviews and recognise what a vital role they play. They were extremely helpful and so polite. They recommended places to eat, were honest that the taxis were expensive (this level of honesty was refreshing in bali) and got us an indonesian sim when we needed. Every time we went past they would smile and wave. We needed an iron and ironing board, all we needed to do was whatsapp them and it was brought up within minutes. The water didn't work one morning and it was fixed promptly. These two ladies were fabulous. We really wanted to recognise what a great job they did in making our stay so pleasant. Thanks ladies!The positive reviews about Pinkcoco was what prompted us to book it and we were glad we did. My wife and I would highly recommend this place.","March 9, 2018","17    PinkCoco Bali

Great location if you plan on walking to the beach and local restaurants. 8 minute walk to Padang-Padang beach, 10 minutes to Bukit Cafe, which is amazing! Great bar next door with live music and a cool vibe. Fantastic restaurant on the premises. Pool is refreshing and there if even an adults only section of you want something more peaceful, although I never found it necessary as the hotel guests, kids included, seemed very relaxed and chilled out. Felt super safe at night walking around. The staff are so friendly and accommodating. Traveled with my boyfriend to Bali and the Gili Islands for three weeks. Came for 3 nights in the beginning of our trip. Tried to extend the stay another night but they were booked. So we traveled around a bit more and came back for our last week. I even decided to stay alone for a few days while waiting to take off on my next adventure. Will definitely be back again!!","March 6, 2018","17    PinkCoco Bali

Perfect room with a big own terrace on top of the building with perfect view. As said the whole staff is taking care for you as a guest. Free cooled cucumberwater at the pool, slices of watermelon are offered, every evening the room is prepared for the night etc. Breakfast you can have at nextdoor restaurant Trattoria, with a wide variety.

Also useful to get the Bluebird taxi app - we used the hotel's cars a couple of times to get to destinations, but found ourselves being ripped off by local (unlicensed) taxis back, so Bluebird is definitely the way forward - and 10x cheaper (literally, in some cases).We loved our stay at PinkCoco and would definitely return if we found ourselves in Uluwatu again!","October 2, 2017","17    PinkCoco Bali

On day three I asked for fresh orange juice but didn't get 'fresh' yet couple two tables down did. Perhaps to improve the breakfast experience, rather than limiting the choices it might be better to give guests a $$$ cap and allow to chose anything from the menu to that value.- staff knowledge, we wanted to hire bicycles as our insurance didn't cover me as a pillion passenger on a scooter/motor bike. Staff had little knowledge of where we could hire bicycles. Turns out there are what appear to be some good bicycles only a couple of hundred meters away. Instead based on the advice provided we walked into the main part of town when we could have got them much closer and appeared to be much better than what we hired.- bed, while comfortable was noisy getting in and out.Despite these small things, we would recommend and if we come back to Lembongan would stay again.

The room was fairly big and comfortable and the staff were very helpful and friendly and the service was great, couldn't really fault it. Only negatives were that one side of the room is made up of windows and open shutters, consequently it does very little to block out noise. You can hear everything, from the waves on the beach (lovely) to your next door neighbour using the toilet (not so lovely). The curtains are also very thin and don't block out much light. The room stays lovely and cool but if you're a light sleeper like me, you'll be woken by the sun by 6.30 every day. Overall though, great price and beautiful location.

The transfers were faultless and a very smooth crossing, upon arrival on Lembongan they use a floating jetty rather than having to wade through the water. The hotel location in our opinion was perfect, beachfront yet within walking distance to many bars and a local supermarket. Hotel grounds were very well presented with gardeners constantly maintain the grounds. Our deluxe bungalow was very spacious with a comfortable bed and all required amenities, bathroom consisted of a large wet room with both a shower and separate bath tub. There was always sunbeds available and the pool was both clean and rarely in use. Staff were always smiling and very polite.

1042,"We had a sea view bungalow, overlooking both the pool and the beach. Decent size rooms, Comfortablr beds, great aircon, good wifi, huge bathroom with lots of hot water and lots of English TV channels, including some with movies.Nice size pool, good restaurant, reasonably priced and nice food.9nly downside was that the bungalows have one large panel that has no window, just slats with no mosquito net so whilst it remains private (nobody can see in), there is a chance for bugs and mosquitos to get in, although we had none in our room. It also means you can hear all noise from outside and there was a particularly noisy, selfish Indian family in 2 bungalows a couple of doors up from us and if they were awake, everybody was awake. Could be a problem for light sleepers.Hotel has a nice beach (grit not sand) and is conveniently close to a few shops and bars.Good choice for a stay on Lembongan.

1046,"We are staying in Sanur for two weeks and thought it would be a treat to have two nights away on Lembongan, we only stayed for one. We chose this hotel having read some great reviews online and were really excited about the stay. I have to say that check in was friendly and we were given cold drinks/towels on arrival. Our room wasn't quite ready but this was because we were early, having arrived with Glory boats ( great service by the way) at around 10.30. This wasn't a problem as there are plenty of restaurants along the beach to sit and wait.When we were shown to our room, we were initially very pleased, as it seemed comfortable and clean. However, we soon discovered that there were many little things that let the room down:1. No loo roll - we had to ask at reception. 2. No kettle - just an old fashioned filter coffee machine that was a bit grubby. This was odd as there was no filter coffee in the room and if you wanted an instant, you had to walk over to the hotel bar to request hot water.3. No hair dryer, not the biggest deal in the world but a bit inconvenient- again had to ask at reception. 4. For a deluxe room, the bathroom felt a bit dirty and the shower was pretty ineffectual. 5. The safe was very temperamental, there was a trick to getting the numbers to register!6. The bedside light was broken.Maybe the worst thing though was the swimming pool. This is described as an infinity pool I guess if you looked at it from the correct angle, it could well be.2 However, it was very small with only half a dozen beds round it. Also, the pool water itself was quite murky so put us off getting in.On a positive note:1. The location is great with fantastic views of Mount Agung.2. The beach is stunning and water crystal clear.3. Amazing sunset from a bean bag on the beach.Could be a great place if a little more car was taken with the rooms, sorry Pemedal!","March 13, 2019","18    Pemedal Beach Resort

Warm overlooking the beach. If you want to beach swim you may need to invest in some ‘booties’/‘aqua-shoes’ as the rocks/shells/coral is quite harsh underfoot.View is amazing and the sunset is beautiful from the beach.Restaurant ok (basic breakfast but suffice - ask for no onion in your omelette). So many places around for a bite to eat but main meals here are good. Good music.We hired a scooter to get around the island and happy we did. Location is good but limited if you are on foot.

The rooms are gorgeous: each is an individual bungalow and has its own porch, and the inside is entirely made of wood. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Even though the resort does not have its own spa, the staff made it easy to arrange a visit to a nearby Kemilau Spa which exceeded our expectations. It’s oceanfront location was perfect: not only did it allow for direct enjoyment of the beach but also made it convenient to walk along the beach and enjoy other oceanfront restaurants and bars.

1053,"Sadly , we arrived in Bali after a long journey from the UK.On our first night, there was an earthquake which obviously scared us immensely. We were travelling with our 2 children and was very concerned about the situation. We had booked 3 nights at The Pemedal Beach. The morning after the earthquake we rang the Pemedal to advise that we would not be travelling to Nusa Lembongan and staying at Pemedal as we were all too scared to travel to a small island in these circumstances. There had been several earthquakes in the vicinity previously, in addition the sea was very rough. Pemedal advised in the telphone conversation that they would make a 10% charge for our booking and refund the rest of our money.Sadly this has not been the case and a refund and not been given to us.Why would they agree to this and then not honour it?We were looking forward to our stay in Nusa Lembongan but circumstances beyond our control made it unsafe to travel.It is very disappointing that you did not keep your promise, we paid you a lot of money!Lets hope you reconsider and refund us as you promised.","September 19, 2018","18    Pemedal Beach Resort

Our room was of the deluxe type, which is slightly bigger than the other ones, and has a tub, but there’s no way to there’s enough hot water to fill it. When we arrived our room looked clean, but there was a lot of dust and spider webs on the headboard of the bed. We mentioned thos to the staff, but it was never cleaned. We also used the coffee cups provided as well as the two glasses for water, the were not replaced even though we put the out for the cleaner to see. Same thing with our take away feom the restaurant. It was in our room for 3 days, before we removed it ourselves.If you go, go for the view and the pool.

The room is really cute but the bathroom is not, the pressure in the shower barely exist and the bathroom and water doesn't smell very good Im afraid.But I like the room,good fluffy pillows but the but itself really need a matress because you can feel the the feathers(?) in the bed. I think the breakfast is good, you get a meny with many different dishes to choose from. And also coffee and fresh juice. The guy in the restaurant (I don't know his name!!) is so so so nice! I love his smile in the morning :)And the other staff is also really nice and helpful!!They have a beautiful garden which they take good care of! Its really beautiful!There are plenty of sunbeds and a cute infinity pool. But I do think they should set up a few rules by the pool, there is a asia familj here that eat next to the pool and even in it. After they were done there was a half lime flooting around in the pool and rice all over a sunbed.. They were also playing and screening really loud in the pool late at night. So when your bungalow next to the pool (as we are) it gets reaaaally loud. Im not a very pick person Im just trying to be honest! And I don't like food in the pool:)The hotel is on the beach which is Nice but the beach is unfortunately not very clean.. Indonesia and lembongan is really beautiful so its a shame that no one (gouvernment) doesn't do anything about the problem. I think it would be Nice if all the hotels try to do their best and clean the beach next to their hotel. Im not sure Im coming back to lembongan after seeing all the trash here by the beach.. A restaurant close by the hotel are cleaning the beach next to the restaurant and that is really good, all the hotels should do the same. Anyway, the wifi works good most of the times.

We were literally just steps to the pool and beach. Plenty of lounge chairs by the pool and beach.Looks out over Shipwrecks surf break. Staff was friendly enough.Cons - When i asked if they served cocktails (i didnt see any on the menu) I was told no.I'm kind of surprised that no one has mentioned this in their comments. Maybe I misunderstood but I never saw anybody with one in their hand for the entire week we were there. They do have Bintang though and I had my duty free!Rooms were only cleaned maybe every 3rd day. That didnt bother me too much because when i asked for something such as toilet paper, it was quickly provided.There is no shower curtain in the bathroom so the floor can get wet by the toilet etc.The bathroom is a good size though.Breakfast was a bit poor .... The couple of cooked items, (rice & vegetables) were cold and they didnt refill anything so there wasnt much too choose from. Same thing happened every day.I didnt find out until the day before we left that they had another breakfast menu you could order from. It seemed they were reluctant to hand it out because they werent too keen to have to cook.All in all the price was good and we would probably stay there again if we couldn't manage to book our favorite place.

The beach is beautiful right out in front with lounging areas, chairs etc. Shade. The pool was not that clean at the time, lots of kids and families were staying there, so was a bit cloudy and funky. Pemedal is located within walking distance to many restaurants, spas and yoga! We went diving next door at Blue Corner Dive Center, which is literally next door and very convenient! The resort is also quiet since you have to walk a little ways down a little path into town. Our villa had a great porch, clean, comfortable, hot water, safe, no refrigerator which I missed. Nusa Lembongan goes through tons of plastic water bottles, burns trash, which you can smell in the am and pm. I would recommend having large water containers located at the resort so you can refill your water bottles instead of having to buy more and more....I would recommend booking the ferry directly through Pemedal since it's cheaper and better service than booking on your own.

Nusa Lembongan is a fairly small island and is not super clean. We saw people burning garbage not too far away from the hotel. People who book from Agoda are most likely getting the rooms that are the closest to the loud villege/kampung (accidentally saw their check-in check-out board behind the reception). The hotel is very close to the nicely paved main road that has many restaurants and little shops. It was quite convenient for us, although there was always a dog or two, following us when walking from the hotel street to the big road.We were glad we didn't stay around the other beaches as the way to get to some of them, such as the Dream beach, can be a bit confusing if you go by a scooter and some parts of the road are a bit bumpy. We rented a scooter from Pemedal for Rp80k and explored the island. Caution: no insurance, no helmets.

Bungalows are beautiful, clean spacious and well maintained, staff are friendly. Food ok. Con - DO NOT stay in rooms 100 to 106 on northern side of property, the noise from the locals and their roosters is terrible, motorbikes at 5am loud thumping music and roosters crow from 4am to 4pm. Can not put air con on at night it rattles, did ask to move but said fully booked, they looked at air con but no different, ","November 18, 2017","18    Pemedal Beach Resort

1082,"We booked Pemedal Beach Villas through Agoda after considering many other villas- not really knowing much about the location. How wonderfully surprised we were when we arrived to see the most beautiful view out across to the reef and ultimately to Bali. There are only about 20 villas so it is very quite and safe. The room we chose was a superior. It had ample room and a beautiful Balcony we had unit 111 and it is the first on the left looking to the ocean so great uninterrupted views. The rooms are fairly basic with great air con, TV, small wardrobe and some shelves. A good King size bed. The bathroom is huge with good quality toilet a shower and and basin. They supply soap and shampoo but no hairdryers. The linen and towels are changed daily and pool towels are provided.There is no safe in the room nor at reception- but the units are well secure and we had no problems leaving our valuables. There was no fridge or phone....but in all honesty we survived 2 weeks with out these easily. our rooms was about 10 steps to the pool and 15 steps to the restaurant. I believe the delux rooms have a fridge The restaurant has a lovely tropical feel and looks out across the beach. They provided breakfast as part of our package. It was basic but lovely. a choice of omelette/eggs/pancakes/fresh fruit and juice or coffee. the menu changed daily and we sampled everything and were never disappointed. They have a good lunch menu and a different dinner menu. Everything we sampled was lovely. Especially the mash and sauteed vegetables on our last night.You can book boat or fishing tours, island tours, ferry returns all from reception easily and when we wanted to go some where they would organise transport for us and we paid the driver a small fee. They have the best beach front with lovely white sand and sun lounges under thatched wooden umbrella shades. An adequate small infinity pool sits beside the restaurant looking out to sea.Overall we totally enjoyed our stay at this resort, The staff are fabulous and very helpful and special thanks to Santa who really can do anything and always has a great smile and happy greeting. My husband and I are in the close to retirement bracket and we had more than enough to occupy our time here. I give it 4/5. But don't expect a Nusa Dua type of holiday this is a small island and things a very laid back. No pretentiousness here","September 14, 2017","18    Pemedal Beach Resort

1083,When we arrived at the hotel with our 3 kids the room was not ready- the welcome was very bad - we had to wait more than 3 hours - once in the room the beds for the kids were not prepared and we were requested to pay 3 times the price despite the clear content of the contract- no smile at all during the 3 days we stayed until the manager called us and threat us to call the police and kick us out if we do not pay to get the 3 beds for our kids - ( as per mangers own words) - they also refused to serve the breakfast ... the most awful experience ever since we are traveling - and certainly not a place to stay with your family if you are in Bali. We had so many others good experiences on the island.The pemedal hotel is the hotel to avoid !!!!!,"July 31, 2017","18    Pemedal Beach Resort

However if you are a light sleeper the roosters going off in the morning (from 4am) can be a bit annoying - if this is you - pack some earplugs :)The breakfast here is basic but ok.

1094,"Me and my partner booked the Sea View Bungalow for 3 nights. The overall experience was positive and I would highly recommend this place.The place is perched on the hillside over looking Nusa Ceningan that was an amazing view to wake up to. Breakfast is also sent to your room, which made the overall experience a lot more positive. The only downside is the resort is located at a more remote area of the island with less than ideal roads leading up to it. Hence, be prepared to rent a scooter to get around. I read the other reviews that this is a major gripe of the other guests. I guess if this villa was located any where nearer to the ""city"" area (Jungutbatu), the prices would be a lot higher and the villa would lost its charm as a peaceful retreat away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Nonetheless, in this part of the island, there were plenty of really good cafes 10 minutes away such as Mama Mia that did not require reservations to get in (unlike those in the city), but provided good food without the crowd. The staff also provided in every room a booklet detailing all the recommended cafes at different price points.In my opinion, this villa offered very good value at its price.","September 12, 2018","19    Twin Island Villas

I’ve stayed at far less quality places that did were more catering to guests. The improvements are easy to fix so I’m sure this place could be next level.Pros: (1) The rooms are nice and clean. (2) The people working there are warm and friendly Cons: (1) No privacy, while in the “private pool villa” staff would walk into our area unannounced to fix things or clean on at least two occasions. The villa walls are all glass and we could have been undressed. It felt invasive. (3) they didn’t have an iron on site for us to press our clothes, 1* motels have irons...(2) breakfast and dinner is mediocre - juice is watered down and food is bland.

1098,"I am truly surprised to read the past few reviews, as we had an amazing experience at this hotel. We arrived here tired and sleep deprived and were blown away by this place and never felt more relaxed.We had a quick and smooth check in, and got to stay in the room with view over the straight between Lembongan and Cenengan with the yellow bridge, phenomenal! (we booked garden view, not sure if this meant we got an upgrade). The room was nice and clean, and has a nice semi-open bathroom with warm water. There are different options for breakfast and always delivered hot and on time (even earlier once upon request). Our first day we spent relaxing at the hotel, which has phenomenal views over the cliffs with a few different terraces and an infinity pool. Lunch is really good. Personnel is exceptionally friendly and on point to help/serve when needed. Yes the hotel is quite remote, but this is what you get if you want cliff views and tranquility. If you want to get around, you definitely need to know how to ride a scooter, as walking is not an option (the road is very steep with potholes and no lighting). There is a good restaurant direct opposite the place and there are restaurants that offer a pickup + drop-off otherwise. A scooter ride to the Jungutbatu area will take around 20 min.We recommend this place to others and would definitely stay here again!","June 9, 2018","19    Twin Island Villas

1099,"Stayed at Twin Island for 4 nights we stayed in 2 different rooms. The first 3 nights were spent in the Bungalow with Garden view this was a lovely room and we really liked the feel to it. We then had to move for our last night (mistakenly booked 2 different rooms) to the more expensive room of the Double Room with Balcony and Sea View, we was expecting this room to be nicer and although larger the room had 2 lights out of 4 that worked, the fan in room did not work, the door was hanging off the hinge and worst of all the toilet completely stunk of sewage. So already unimpressed with the hotel this on the last night was the icing on the cake. The breakfast was horrendous and by horrendous I mean the food was completely cold when delivered to us twice. We asked the first day for a new one to get a slightly warmer breakfast but by the second day we didn’t even bother and after that breakfast was off the cards for us. You also get wasps attacking you for you breakfast if you have it on your balcony. Which resulted us sitting on edge of our bed trying to eat our cold breakfast. Unpleasant to say the least. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW TO RIDE A MOTORBIKE. This is the biggest factor to the hotel of all. If you do not know how to ride a motorbike you will not be able to get anywhere as this hotel is in the middle of nowhere. Luckily for us we knew how to ride a motorbike so it wasn’t a problem for us. But for someone booking this place unknowingly it could lead to devastating results if you can’t explore anywhere. There is no option provided by the hotel to help you get around or any kind of taxi services on the island.The hotel staff in general were not very helpful. Upon asking advice around the island they were useless. We also requested that we could get a scoopy bike before we arrived at the hotel, which they said would not be a problem and that they could get it from another company/hotel. When we arrived and asked about it they said this is not something they can do and we can only use there bike which was a dirty small bike which was rather uncomfortable for the 2 of us. We also asked twice if we could change this to be given the same answer of no. We also asked if we could stay in our first room the whole 4 nights as we didn’t want to move about and we thought the hotel would have recognised that we had 2 bookings and helped sort this as many other hotels do. They originally said that we wouldn’t have to move room but then said we would have to when showing us to our room. Overall a bad stay at Twin Island Villas, the only positive being the first room we stayed in, but other than that I cannot think of any more positives. It’s a shame really as this could be a nice hotel if they sorted out some of these issues. ","May 23, 2018","19    Twin Island Villas

1101,"People say oh you’ve gone to such and such a place you should write a review-I always think....what’s the point of a review and THEN I happened upon a place like this and I realize I need to share my experience especially since it’s a small island and if I wish to return and find this holiday oasis- others need to know it exists!! I'll say this experience was a Surf and Turf holiday, since I spent time on land and at sea. Each morning I enjoyed my delicious breakfast brought to me by the lovely staff, everything plated and ready for consumption with a view that you will never experience any place else but sitting on the balconies of Twin Island Villas.Looking out over the yellow bridge with a view of Nusa Ceningan and Nusa Penida in your peripheral is a moment to treasure. So yes, now you know...Twin Island Villas is all about location- location- location!! Complete with the attention to details and the commitment to service is what makes this place stellar. Cleanliness is godliness and in my room I felt like a goddess. The bathroom is semi outdoor letting in just the right amount of breezey sea air. The modern fixtures and cool sinks caught my eye and I've made mental notes for whenever I build my house to include the stone sink. The luxurious and infinite pool called to me on a daily basis however because I went diving and on a day excursion to Nusa Penida I was only able to indulge for one night.And now comes the surf how convenient to have accommodation and diving all in one place!! All I had to do to get ready for my dive was wake up go down to the front office and sit with Bryce to talk about step by step how the experience would unfold. When I got in the water I actually knew what was coming next. They provided complete transportation to and from the accommodation to the dive site where we launched. The whole time on the boat your are starring into the most crystal clear water with blue hues for days. It was all a visually stunning experience; taking in the sea on the Ceningan channel on the way to Nusa Penida. Capt Pinky and I were all smiles and heading to the dive sites made me feel like being on this beautiful island was where everyone needs to be. Onwards! as the crystal blue water on either side of the boat cut into the waves effortlessly; we arrived to our first dive site. Bryce our instructor explained everything he had talked about on land I gearded up with his help and did my first entry into the water- Perfect! I gave myself a 10. My friend came next I give him a 10 too. We came to the front of the boat at Bryce's direction...now remember this is my very first time diving in the sea and he explained everything and as we descended and the air was released from my vest, I had a moment of extreme peace and calm. Swimming with the fish is magnificent! Down and down we went from my exclamation you would think it was meters long but in reality it’s probably only 6 feet deep there I got to see amazing sites and I was guided with an occasional OK sign in my peripheral, in my front vision, or directly in front of me. With each signal I felt completely comfortable and I responded with glee a word hardly ever used but so appropriate for this instance. I emphatically recommend Twin Island Villas for accommodation an diving. Book your next holiday here and I am sure you will have a wonderful experience.","February 24, 2018","19    Twin Island Villas

1103,"Twin Island Villas is nestled away between trees and hidden on top of a hill which looks out over the ‘yellow bridge’ and Nusa Ceningan. It’s quiet here. Peaceful. When we first arrived, the staff were kind enough to pick us up from our prior accommodation on the busier side of the island and transport us up the winding hills to the villas. With superb views out across the two islands, the balcony was the highlight of our room, and featured comfortable seating and even a game of Jenga to pass the rainy days of the musim hujan (rainy season).The location of the property is inconvenient, yet brilliant at the same time. The accommodation doesn’t have its own restaurant (breakfast is served in the rooms though) and it’s too far to walk to access the island’s restaurants and bars. Renting a motorcycle is the best option and the staff are happily able to arrange this. The remoteness, despite its inconvenience (especially during the wet season), is also perhaps why you will love this place.There is a swimming pool here and although it is rather small, it boasts excellent views over the strait and was mostly unused by other guests during our stay. Twin Island Villas also offers scuba diving and the staff were approachable, knowledgeable and helpful in this field.","January 23, 2018","19    Twin Island Villas

1105,"People that complain about the tranquillity of this part of the island just don't get it; that is why you should go here! A badly maintained road to the resort makes sure there is no traffic noise...! The rooms are all very different and probably the only minor point could be noise from other guests, but as we chose a bungalow, we had no complaints. We enjoyed the freshly cooked breakfast and found it to be sufficient, if anything maybe some more fruit would top it of. The reason for choosing this resort would be the surroundings, the dive facility and the staff. Kip and Sarah run a good place and staff here do speak good english, something you shouldn't take for granted here, and are therefore very helpful with booking boat tickets etc.The dive facility is very well run, equipment modern and well maintained and safety comes first. As a well travelled dive instructor, I can highly recommend them.For dinner, restaurants will pick you up and drop you off (again, the wonderful staff will help you here), but D.Mas is 10 steps away and worth the 10 steps.Do rent a scooter (cheap and quickly organized) and drive around to see why Twin island is great to stay and relax.","December 28, 2017","19    Twin Island Villas

1106,"My second trip to Lembongan and while the island has developed a lot since my last visit, Twin Island is still in an undisturbed little haven away from the occasionally pumping music of Jungut Batu!It's a grown a little since my last trip, some additional rooms and a much needed sun patio in front of the bar for afternoon tanning sessions, but still maintains its island charm. The new staff are smiley and helpful and make a good poolside sandwich and cocktail!Don't read too much into the picky reviews, this isn't The Ritz and should be critiqued accordingly! The rooms are perfectly well cleaned and towels and bedding changed as needed without trying to kill the environment. The rooms have a rustic Balinese feel and their little quirks but this is the kind of island living I crave when escaping the city lights of Europe.If you want a polished, over-sanitised, clinical room in a large hotel with hundreds of staff, then this place isn't for you, but if you want to feel like you've truly escaped and see the real side of Lembongan/Bali, I'd book it in a heartbeat.Either way, enjoy your holidays people!","December 10, 2017","19    Twin Island Villas

This place is a bit far from the Mushroom nor Jungutbatu Port, however they have a stunning view (you can see the colorful Yellow Bridge at night, and enjoy the greenish scenery from the top). We stayed in Treetop room - this room is incredible. Mostly designed with bamboo, it is in the second floor hence you'll see the top of Lembongan as your morning view. The service is awesome, they offer me a very nice deal for transportation from Sanur to Lembongan (return trip). They also has scooter rent and snorkeling package.

1110,"My friend and I stayed at Twin Island Villas for two weeks and found it an amazing place to stay. Initially the villas being a little out of the way can seem like a con, but once we explored the island and came to realise how crazy with hustle and bustle the main parts of town could be we came to greatly appreciate the tranquility and serenity of Twin Island Villas, with its private and child free environment. Highly recommend getting a scooter to get around. The room we had was beautiful and spacious, with a basic breakfast provided directly to your room to start your day. Bed was comfy and large, made for a great nights sleep. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. My friend was sick and had to visit the doctors and the staff went above and beyond by taking her to the clinic and helping us explain to the doctor what the issue was. They would book dinners for us each night with free pick up and drop offs which are provided by the restaurants. Kipp and Sarah who are the managers, were nothing but perfect. They were professional but chilled and friendly which made them feel like just a couple of friends we made along the way. One major convenience is you can dive with the hotel via Twin Island Dive. They take you directly from the hotel, to the boat and back to the hotel when you’re done.We completed our Open Water certification when we were there. This wasn’t a planned part of our trip but was the best experience by far. Kipp (manager & diving instructor), was an amazing instructor. Us being idiots, didn’t quite take to diving like a fish to water, Kipp was patient….more than I can comprehend but with his encouragement and experience we were able to get our certificates and be comfortable diving. Kipp has a passion and love of diving which makes you feel safe at all times and inspired us to start planning our next diving holiday!","August 6, 2017","19    Twin Island Villas

Originally we weren't confident enough to do our diving & time was an issue for us but Kipp took us on the dive boat for us to do some snorkelling.Since travelling South East Asia for over 3 months, I've got to say this has been the best and most amazing island to snorkel on. It's paradise. It also made me want to come back and do my diving. Especially after watching the way Kipp & Brice were with the divers made me feel at ease to be in their hands if I was to do it in the future. Sarah and kipp & all the local staff at twin island villas went above and beyond for their guests. I would 100% recommend for anyone wanting to relax, dive or even just spend half a day on the boat snorkelling! Ps. The villas had amazing plunge pools!! ","August 5, 2017","19    Twin Island Villas

1114,"We chose this hotel partly as it was child free, but also for the amazing scenery that we'd seen photo's of. We were not dissapointed as there is an awesome view wherever you find yourself standing.Upon check in, with a welcome drink to boot, we were shown to our room which overlooked the Ceningan channel and the swimming pool, it really feels like you are alone in your own paradise spot as you are not overlooked anywhere.I cannot fault any of the staff in any respect, the local staff are SO friendly and the managers (Kipp & Sarah) really put themselves out to make everyone's stay perfect, from arranging to call local restaurants to place a reservation for dinner to offering suggestions for activities or sightseeing from the local experts.Should you happen to be a Diver, you will be in paradise here as the on site PADI 5 star dive resort makes daily trips to the many dive sites around the islands, and all conducted with the utmost safety underwater.Breakfast is good, having it served on your own private balcony / patio is a brilliant start to the day.All in all, a beautiful hotel which you will not be dissapointed with.","July 12, 2017","19    Twin Island Villas

1116,"We stayed at Twin Islands In July 2016 and I am writing this review a year after as we just looked though our photos from our Bali holiday. We went to a number of places in Bali but Lembongan was our favourite and that is partly due to Twin Islands.We wanted accommodation that gave us a luxury retreat feel but with access to sights and activities. We were not disappointed. The accommodation was lovely, small number of little huts, a small bar, breakfast served to our hut to eat on the balcony and friendly hosts. We loved the secluded location, very relaxing! You will need a scooter to get around, but in all honesty this is the only way to get around the island anyway, so if you wanted to check out the island you will need one no matter where you stay.There is a little restaurant across the road and the food there is lovely (I'm vegetarian and it is limited, but then it was everywhere in Bali), but some of the larger restaurants will pick you up in a truck and you can book via the accommodation staff.There is a pool at Twin Islands but there is also one across the road that you can use, but there are so many stunning beaches around the island, a pool really isn't necessary! The only downside was that due to the huts being made from wood, we could hear people going up and down the stairs to the hut above, but earplugs solved that problem!We couldn't recommend it enough!!

1117,"I am currently travelling South East Asia with my other half on slightly more than a shoe string budget, so this place qualified as a bit of a splurge, but it is more than worth it. Prior to arriving Kipp and Sarah (the owners) were flawless with telephone and email correspondence being as helpful as they could, which makes everything worlds easier, and creates a much more personal feel. The bungalow itself is everything that you will want and more, with a fully stocked mini-bar with air-conditioning that is almost too good. Minor mishaps happened during our stay on the island (nothing to do with Twin Island though) and Sarah helped us out an unbelievable amount. The kitchen is great, nice and clean, the bar has an astonishing view, as does the pool and staff were superb! I do not have a bad word to say about this place. Would highly recommend this place to friends and family alike. ","June 23, 2017","19    Twin Island Villas

1118,"My boyfriend and I recently stayed at Twin Island Villas where we had nothing short of a wonderful time. The hotel sits on Lembongan island, yet looks over the yellow bridge and Nusa Ceningan, meaning you have easy access to explore both islands as you please.It needs to be said that both islands are suitable to explore by scooter, so if you're not a scooter driver or don't want to pay for someone to drive you around on one, then neither Lembongan nor Ceningan are the destinations for you. The most beautiful spots are those usually accessed by an unkempt, bumpy road - such is the natural beauty of these largely untouched islands. Twin Island Villas is no different. You'll travel down a bit of a bumpy, dusty road to get there, but when you do the seclusion and view are worth the journey.What makes the experience at Twin Island particularly stand-out is the familial hospitality of Kipp and Sarah. Just ask for recommendations on what to see, where to go, where to eat and they'll happily share their local tips. And when it comes to great snorkel and dive spots, these guys are the best. Owning a dive shop connected to the hotel, they make sure you have a safe and enjoyable experience every single time you head out on the water(which you absolutely should - the underwater world is half of the beauty of the islands). My boyfriend is a diver, while I prefer to snorkel, and even that was no issue. They were able to organise for a boat to take us to spots which were suitable for both, so everyone had a wonderful time.After a day out exploring, Twin Island is the perfect place to return to and relax, with comfortable spacious rooms, clean airy bathrooms and views that are still fuelling my daydreams weeks later. We'll definitely be back to Nusa Lembongan, and when we go, we know exactly where we'll be staying.","June 13, 2017","19    Twin Island Villas

But when I read recommendations in tripadvisor, I just wanna have a try of this villa.Luckily, the staff member, Ayu, enthusiastically welcomed us. She helped us to arrange the room and breakfast. She also helped us to find a driver, taking us around of Lembongan. She is a cheerful and nice girl, which make our trip be more funny.We booked tree top villa. The Balinese room is not really big but that is enough for three people. The room can perfectly see the view of Ceningan. It would be very nice if you sit in front of view to enjoy your breakfast. And don't miss the adorable swimming pool! I ordered the villa and an additional bed through agoda. Unfortunately, The villa informed us they didn't receive the additional bad order. They are not available to take the bed immediately because they didn't have male staff members at that time. I think agoda should more communicate with the hotels because this is not the first time I saw these kind of things happen. Although the things were not perfect, if you love enjoying the peaceful and natural villa, this place is still a choice. ","June 12, 2017","19    Twin Island Villas

1120,"This resort did not live up to its expectations, my friends and I were constantly having problems with no solutions provided. When we first arrived the owners were very pleasant, they showed us a map of the island along with offering us beverages which we believed were complimentary, but when checking out we were unexpectedly charged for the drinks. For the most part our rooms were clean but there was a huge open window in the bathroom, this made us uncomfortable because it could be dangerous at night. The window is big enough for a grown person to comfortably come in with ease. When this issue was bought up with the owners they played it off like it was no big deal. If there was security near by or staff who spent the night we would have understood but by 9:00 p.m. there was no staff to help incase of an emergency, this resulted in many sleepless nights. Also the safety deposit boxes in the rooms were not attached to anything and could easily be lifted out of the room. We also bought this up with the owners and they didn't consider it to be a problem. Although the cooking staff was friendly the breakfast was inedible, the toast was rock hard, the eggs were very salty and runny. We paid extra to have breakfast included and most days didn't end up eating it. The pool light was broken so after sunset we were not able to use the pool and the water was very frigid, we also talked to the owners about this and nothing was done and we weren't able to enjoy the pool. No where does it state how far this resort is from the main hub of the island. It is approximately a bumpy 20 minute ride uphill into what look like a forest. We were charged $25(USD) each time by the resort to get transportation to reach the bottom of the hill. (Sometimes the owners would change the amount and even increase it to $25) We had a very hard time finding a cab that would drive us back to the resort at night, and if they did, the charge was $50… That’s how secluded this place is. This also become very dangerous at night because there was very little lights driving back to the resort and the roads were very bumpy and we were unsure if we were heading the right way or if were safe. The resort set up snorkelling for our group and we thought we would be in good hands as this resort is also a dive school. We requested to have life jackets for everybody participating just incase. When we arrived on the boat there were only a few life jackets and they were mostly broken… They also took us on a day the waves were incredibly high and strong so much so our snorkels were filling with water making what was suppose to be a beautiful experience very scary. It was near impossible to try to swim or even look at the fish without being pushed by the current. I would not recommend staying here.","June 1, 2017","19    Twin Island Villas

We stayed in 2 different rooms (overlooking the pool directly and bungalow Cinta) as our itenarary changed, but both Kipp and Sara did their best to accommodate us. The location can't be beat and overlooks the Ceningan (yellow) bridge. The entire staff is amazing and go above expectations to please you. My only knock would be that the AC in bungalow Cinta is not strong, and can leak drops on you. Additionally, the en suite toilet in the bungalow is step down and has a large gap behind the step..........my wife was a bit freaked out as critters may crawl through. But this is minor compared to the overall experience. Side note: Kipp is an amazing dive instructor, highly recommend diving with him.","May 24, 2017","19    Twin Island Villas

After coming across Twin Villa online and dealing with P directly over email, I knew this is the place where we were heading to. We stayed on Bali mainland which was an experience but that was not our definition of ""vacation"" for us. I am so glad that we extended our stay at Twin Villa's because it was exactly what we had visioned! We stayed in the Villa with the private pool, even though the main pool area was quite and not many people around to bother you. Where Twin Villa is located, is very quite but easily accessible to get on a scooter and head to the busy parts of the island! You can also walk across the road to D'Mas Huts for a quick bite to eat. The staff were amazing! Such friendly people - Darren and Prashanti always giving you ideas on where to go and what to do which helps especially when you have limited time (because there are so many things to do and you want to do them all). I would highly recommend a trip to Nusa Ceningan and Nusa Penida (snorkeling is out of this world). Snorkeling can be done with the Twin Dive team - remember to take extra memory for your GoPro because the marine life is stunning! Just beware of massive lizzards that make duck sounds, they like to enjoy the luxury of Twin Villas too :) Other than that, enjoy the chickens waking you up in the morning from a distance and enjoy the pure beauty of this amazing island.","January 24, 2017","19    Twin Island Villas

1131,"My friend and I stayed at Twin Island Villas for 4 days at the end of September and dived with them for 2. When we first arrived on Nusa Lembongan, all the taxis were saying 'Ah Twins, the one with the view' so it sounded promising and when we arrived I was honestly blown away with the view. The infinity pool is spectacular, and we stayed in room 1 which had stunning views over neighbouring Nusa Cenigan from the room, bathroom and balcony. We couldn't have been treated any better, the staff were super friendly and went all out to make sure we had a good time. We hired scooters from them for 2 days which was a great way to get around the island and they made top recommendations for places to eat. This is a unique and quiet place and we were so glad to have stumbled across it. There's a restaurant just behind the hotel for food at lunch/dinner (I can highly recommend the sweet potato fries). Breakfast is served at a time of your choice on your balcony and the musli and pancakes were both delicious. We also spent a couple of days diving with Twins and the facility and instructors were top. We're both instructors ourselves who have dived around the world but this is a truly unique dive centre. Both Darren and Kip went out of their way to make sure we got to see what we wanted, which for us was manta rays. After all the boats had left the dive site after the first dive, Kip let us stay around to do the second dive here and it resulted in the most phenomenal manta ray encounter. We were the only people on the site and got to spend an hour less than a metre from these amazing creatures. Thanks to Kip for the best experience we could have hoped for. It's certainly an experience you wouldn't get with big dive centres. Unfortunately we lost the GoPro on the next island we went to but it means we'll be back next year to retake the footage!Thank you to Twins for making Nusa Lembongan the best part of our Indonesian trip, we'll be back to find the mola molas as well as manta rays.

Scooters are a must, they're so much fun and give you so much freedom. Amazing views and an awesome breakfast. The staff were super friendly and helpful.

1133,Overlooking the Chanel between Lembongan and Cenningan island. Surrounded by trees and surprisingly very cool (cold) place to relax - super amazing chicken burgers and ice ice cold beers this place will be your #1 spot to locate yourself new road patched its way comfortable ride to the hill top side. With all sorts of activities from Diving (all new gear) fancy boat and not to mention the most warm welcoming friendliest staff (Kipp and Darren) go out of their way to satisfy your needs and make sure all settled in. Loads of space and rooms are AMAZING! I would recommend this place to families coupes and even singles looking to to escape. Nusa Penida where you get mola mola and manta rays is just a 15min boat ride away with some spectacular diving. These guys know their dive sites. Great snorkel sets for sale will set you back a meet 40$ and your all sorted to experience a world and family vibe in your weekend away in what I like to say PARADISE!!!

1134,Lovely Place at the top of a hill but a nightmare to get up and down if you re not used to riding on really lousy roadsI kind if expected bad roads but this was a little bit ridiculous.

1135,"Now, let me say first that my opinions are based on expectations that come with a price of 88 Euros per night for our room - which is European standards...At a first glance this place is heavenly - the view onto the yellow bridge to Nusa Cinigan, the lush greenery etc - it is the things that you can't see at a first glance that make this place not so great and then some.Not so great:- theres a huge building site all around the hotel with hammering, electric sawing, levelling and so on. Hardly a minute of quiet all day. The staff offered to go an talk to the builders if it's too loud, but basically that would have meant for them to stop altogether- there are many little things missing in the room - the TV doesn't have any channels, the coffee box isn't refilled, our soap wasn't refilled in the three days we were here, there is no shelf to put clothes, there is no hook to hang towels, the shower is either super hot or cold- the moment we wanted to enter our private villa with plunge pool one of the managers broke our door (!) It then took several hours for them to sort of fix it until the lock broke and we were locked out with several handyman fidgeting with our door for quite some time. The staff were trying to be nice and friendly about it, but it didnt exactly make me feel secure and other than a spoken apology they did not do anything- the hotel is in the middle of the jungle so u definitely need a ride (and off the beaten track romanticses it a litte - it's 15 minutes up and down the worst road) - they provide u with a bike (which is great) but they don't have a free shuttle service U have to pay if you want them to drive you. However, many restaurants offer a free shuttle.- the complementary breakfast was a joke on two out of three days. The cooperate with a Warung next door (which has really good food). Breakfast was: 9 little pieces of fruit, 2 pieces of toast with little marmelade and 2 eggs. Also: coffee and juice. However, we paid 88 Euros per night (which seems incredible now) and for that kind of money u get a continental breakfast in Europe. If this place had been much cheaper we would have been ok with the many shortcomings - but that kind of money in this region should really go a long way.- last but not least the most horrible part: the loudest chanting noise ever! The manager had told us that 'nice changing wafts over' from the other island, but it is more like somebody scrapes out your eardrums with a spoon. On our second day it started around 4 pm - a man saying something and then a woman 'singing' through cracked loud speakers blasting across the island (people, it sounds exaggerated, it isn't) - and it didn't stop. It went on until about 22 pm and drove us close to insanity. When it finally stopped we were so so happy. However, it resumed at 7.30 and basically continued in one form or another all day until in the evening the man returned even louder. We put earplugs in and pillows over our heads and it went on and on until about midnight. No chance at quiet and peaceful.Things we liked:- even though I was really concerned about bugs (am allergic to bites) there were hardly any around- there's a water dispenser in the room so you have plenty of water- the public pool is so so nice- the staff is really friendly and try to help you with anything- the view is fantastic- very comfy bed- if you want a bike they organize one for youAll in all it can be said that this place has a lot of potential to be really nice, but it isn't yet.","September 19, 2016","19    Twin Island Villas

We had a very nice room with a great view & next to the infinity pool. Very nice breakfast served to your room each day. Staff very friendly & helpful.

1138,It was a hard and bumby ride to get there. A bit away from everything. Room was nice. No deposit safe and there was a big window hole for easy access.Nearly knocked myself unconcious when going to the sunken bathroom at night. Problem due to a loose piece of wood on the first step. Management seemed to be missing all the time when we needed them and most of them struggled to speak English. No restaurant and bar area was average to poor.

However, because the island is so small, you get wherever you want to go quickly with the motorbikes you can rent there (yes, the road is bumpy, but it's fun to drive the bikes). The staff is very kind and helps you with wathever your needs are. The breakfast they serve - in your room, if you wish! - is super delicious.

Very peaceful with lots of surrounding greenery, an excellent spot to see the sunrise and take an early morning dip in the pool. The staff were fantastic, all very friendly and helpful. This would be a perfect location for travellers looking for a quiet romantic hide away. The only downside is the roads on the island tend to be a bit bumpy and getting there on the buggy can be a bit bouncy! We hired a scooter from the hotel and zipped around the island which was initially quite daunting but once you get used to the roads it's a lot of fun!

1147,"We and another couple just spent three night at Kano Sari. We occupied the second floor rooms with a lovely great room between the two rooms. Kano Sari is truly amazing! We had arranged prior to our arrival in Bali with Yunita to be picked up in Sanur. Their driver came to pick us up for a small fee and took us to the hidden compound. The grounds are beautiful with lush plants, pool, outside dining area and a spa and sets above a canyon and river. The entire place is tastefully decorated and open air, immaculate. Our rooms had everything we needed and was air conditioned. There was a frig, safe, water container, lovely view, mosquito netting for the night, spacious bathroom with walkin shower and lots of amenities and evening turndown service. A very delicious breakfast was included each morning. Each evening we were able to select from the menu our breakfast choices. Everything was very fresh and divine. We also enjoyed two tasty dinners. One night we sat in the outside patio and one night inside. The menu is delicious and we each selected different dishes. Yunita and Novi always gave us their full attention and are lovely, kind and conscientious hosts. We really appreciated these ladies and their assistants! The Kano Sari also offers transportation included in the cost around Ubud. We had their driver take us to the market, a restaurant one evening and Novi drove us to a shop we were interested in seeing. They also arranged to have a driver take us to the airport when departing and they arranged for a day driver to take us to temples and sights. But central Ubud is within walking distance if you do not use their car service. My husband and I each had two massages during our stay. We simply told them what time we wanted and they made the arrangements. We really enjoyed the wonderful massages.We would return to the Kano Sari if we ever went half way around the world to Bali again. It is incredible! We made our reservation months in advance. So my best suggestion would be is to do the same because there are only six rooms.","May 21, 2019","20    Kano Sari Ubud Villas

1154,"Staff: This is what made the stay as great as it was. The staff, especially Novi the manager, were extremely sweet and helpful about everything. They voluntarily offered to serve us Halal meat upon learning we were Muslim, communicated with airline staff on our behalf when our luggage was delayed, and took us to the superstore outside shuttle hours when we were hungry. Loved it.Room: We stayed in the Jepun Suite which was very large and spacious. For us, the layout made it so that we barely used the lounge so in retrospect, we might have chosen a simpler and cheaper room. Everything was comfortable and clean. Only downside of the open-style construction is that there were bugs and geckos in the room. The mosquito net around the bed meant that the bugs weren't disturbing us but the geckos were noisy and we were a bit weirded out at times.Food: Simple but fresh and great breakfast everyday. They typically have you choose the night before and prepare it for you in the morning. We were served breakfast in the villa once at our request too.Others: Nice pool with warm water. Staff helped us plan for and reserve activities (specifically White Water Rafting and the Mt. Batur trek) at reasonable prices.At checkout they were ind enough to accept dollars as well at a fair exchange rate.

No private pool, no fancy restaurant and not much of a view, either. It´s small and intimate, it´s CLEAN, it has a great layout and it makes you feel like home. The latter is on the account of two things: 1. The calm, airy and relaxing common area. Stepping in the main entrance is like entering an oasis, with an open living room seamlessly connecting with a lush garden and pool area. 2. The lovely staff. Coming here makes you feel like visiting friends, even if it´s coming back from a trip in the afternoon or returning for a new visit the year after the last one. Rooms are basic. But hey, who needs more than basic when there is a good size room, fridge minibar, aircon and good size bathroom. All of them with spotless cleanliness. One of the great features at Kano Sari is a place for massage and yoga. Plenty of space, an open and airy but still shaded space with next to no view into it from the common area or rooms. Brilliant architecture!There´s no fancy restaurant at Kano Sari. Still, guest have tasty food available all day.Kano Sari is 10-15 mins walk from the Jl Raya Ubud main street. Its within walking distance from most things in Ubud, depending on how you define walking distance. Since our last visit, owner Karen has established a free shuttle service for guests within Ubud center (limited by Monkey Forest and Ubud Palace). Great!Suggestions for improvements: Beds are getting somewhat worn, mattresses will hopefully be replaced in a not too distant future.","November 9, 2018","20    Kano Sari Ubud Villas

Having the bed turned down at night and plugging in the mosquito repellent was a lovely touch. I really enjoyed being treated like royalty. The staff recommendations were spot on as we did a cooking course, ayurvedic massage and saw a reggae band at LOL bar.

1167,"There's not many places that get a fantastic review from me, I'm a bit picky. I have travelled a lot in my life.... A lot.This place is just amazing, and what really makes it is the extra touches and effort gone to by the staff.On our day of arrival I had decided that I would propose should there be somewhere suitable. Of course there was. After I told the staff my plan they went out and got flowers and decorated the rotunda for me to surprise my partner. It was magical.The funny thing was that prior to me proposing, my partner actually mused to me that this would be a good place for a wedding. So yes, we're going to get married here too!!All the staff are fabulous, special mention to Novi. They even figured out my birthday from the passport. The included breakfast is much more than a hotel buffet and the choices vary each day. They can accommodate any variation too.Lots of room combinations so if you have a child or family, pick the room that suits. There are a total of 6 villas in the property. There is a common lounge area where breakfast can be taken if you don't like the area by the pool. A phone is included to take with you to call for pick up when you are out and about. Lots of other amazing things that I won't spoil.Yes there are some midges and mosquitoes but this is Bali you can't blame anyone for that. They include earplugs, we heard some interesting animals at night and there's one rooster in particular whose clock is a bit off and starts up at 0330!Love that they consider the environment and don't have disposable bottles but instead use refillable ones.Can't wait to go back!

1168,"This is a stunning find and hands-down the best place we stayed in Bali! The staff were sooo unbelievably helpful - they couldn't do enough for us! They organised tours and activities, and offered local knowledge on a wide range of things. The villa is so beautiful and every part was thoughtfully constructed together. It is a short walk into the center of town (10-15 mins) but they offer a free drop and pick up service. We loved the beautiful room, the view from the balcony into (what felt like) the jungle, the breakfasts served poolside, and the chilled atmosphere of the place. Despite its great location, it was perfectly peaceful at night. The perfect place to stay to appreciate all that Ubud has to offer. Only wish we could've stayed longer.","September 2, 2018","20    Kano Sari Ubud Villas

1172,"Kano Sari Villa's are absolutely divine. Our experience from check in to check out was flawless and as other reviews have mentioned, the staff are incredible. Firstly, they arranged pick up and transport from the airport direct to the hotel for a very reasonable price. On arrival, we were greeted by Novi (she's absolutely lovely!), with welcome drinks in hand (Delicious!) and were given the tour of the villa. We stayed in the ""main house"" second floor Capung suit. It was stunning, overlooking the pool and gardens. Everything was spotless, the bathroom was beautiful and the bed was one of the most comfortable we've had in Bali. Every morning our breakfast was made fresh to order at a requested time, and selected the night prior from a very comprehensive menu. The juices are delicious as well! We did not eat any other meals in the resort (so many restaurants in Ubud), but based on breakfast would recommend this if suited. The staff at Kano Sari make the experience here worth every penny. You will not get a better experience in Ubud for the price... Don't look any further :)","July 15, 2018","20    Kano Sari Ubud Villas

We were picked up by our driver and friend, and taken to our villa. On arrival we were met by old and new staff members and with such a warm welcome was the start of a fantastic time spent at Ubud. Each time Kano Sari has undergone beautiful and colourful decor changes thanks to the wonderful host Karen. Her beautiful staff are always there to help, cook, and make every holiday wish you would like to have come true. Nothing is too much trouble for anyone of them, and questions, hints or ideas for a great holiday are readily available.This time we stayed in Taman, a gorgeous suite, with its own Semi outdoor bathroom, which is one of the most amazing bathrooms I have experienced. The suite is only a few steps to the pool area or the main house. The entire villa is literally a gardeners paradise. Every which way you look there are nooks and crannies of plants and flowers and secret sections of the garden to explore We thoroughly enjoyed our trip yet again, and got to have new experiences thanks to all the staff, drivers and the wonderful Karen.

Breakfast is very good. There are different choices every day and you select your order the night before. The best thing about this place is the staff. They are are brilliant, friendly, always smiling and go out of their way to help their guests. Nothing is too much trouble. My only gripe was that the room we stayed in had walls which didn't go right up to the ceiling, so I'd recommend booking a different room if you value privacy. Despite that, I'd still recommend booking the Kano Sari.","June 28, 2018","20    Kano Sari Ubud Villas

1175,"Our most recent stay at Kano Sari was our third overall - every time we visit Ubud we've stayed here, and don't even bother researching other places. Kano Sari is relaxed and never over-crowded (there are 5 villas total), so you can always lounge by the pool in peace and quiet. The food is delicious and can be served to you anywhere in Kano Sari (our favourite spot was next to the pool!). The in-house massages that the staff can arrange for you are blissful and extremely well-priced. Most importantly, the staff at Kano Sari are incredibly kind and helpful, I feel so comfortable when staying there that it makes leaving very difficult!When we next visit Ubud, there's no question about where we'll be staying.","June 23, 2018","20    Kano Sari Ubud Villas

We arranged for the hotel's driver to pick us up from the airport and he was there to meet us and took care of our transport and hotel checkin with care and expertise. Our room was perfect. The bathroom was beautiful and there was a dressing room with mirror and heaps of wardrobe space, and a clean water dispenser. No need to buy water!The staff were excellent and provided everything we needed including transportation to various restaurants and places of interest in the Ubud area, all part of the unique 5-star service. However the cost was surprisingly low. The pool was divine with good access for a person with bad knees. Because the hotel only caters for approximately 12 guests the pool was never crowded and we usually had it to ourselves.

We also went to the Bali Pulina coffee plantation which was a great opportunity to sample (and buy!) local coffee to take home. Nyoman speaks excellent English and knows the area like the back of his hand. We quickly learned that one of the most important aspects of visiting Bali is having a good driver. For a nominal daily charge, you significantly enhance your experience here.All the staff are exceptional, friendly, attentive and a wonderful resource to make the most of your time in Ubud. It really feels like you are staying with family. Karen, the owner, Gede, the guest manager, along with Jero and Meri went out of their way to make the experience special. Jero prepared our last meal and it was one of the best we’d had anywhere in Ubud. Stay in at least for one night! She made us a red curry and chicken with mushroom and bacon sauce that was out of this world.

The whole family thought Kano Sari was surberb, all villas were equally impressive, each decorated with local woods, colourful cushions and local artwork. Oh and the beds are great. The rooms are spotlessly clean and have a daily housekeeping as well as turnover service. As usual the Kano Sari staff headed by Novi, weaved their magic.

The grounds are just amazing and the pool wonderful. The staff were so lovely and just made you feel like you were there with an amazing family. Novie in particular was just so welcoming and lovely. Daily breakfast jaws just wow and the team so accomodating, we did not have a breakfast that we didn’t love. Excellent recommendations on drivers, things to do and other restaurants to visit. We will be back there for sure. ","December 20, 2017","20    Kano Sari Ubud Villas

1197,"Our first visit to Bali startet in Ubud and at Kano Sari. I cant see how it could have started any better. Owner/manager Karen wasn´t present during our visit. But Gede, Novi and the rest of the staff at Kano Sari made us feel genuinely welcome. Cleanliness was spotless in the room, pool and common areas. Breakfast with multiple choices (booked the night before) served at long table in main building, by the pool or i the room. All breakfast options delicious. Snacks and well tasting light meals are served upon request throughout the day. The staff also made nice recommendations for dining out, and even assisted in ordering food deliveries from other restaurants in Ubud. Kano Sari is situated in a small street, some 15 minutes walk from the centre of Ubud. Nice, quiet area. Just prepare to be awakened by the neighbour´s rooster. The room (Sungai suite) is the lowest situated room at Kano Sari. It´s spacious, with aircondition and a king size bed with mosquito net. The mosquito net is there for a reason. Spacious bathroom, partly open towards the woods and the river below. Shelves in the bathroom for keeping clothes and luggage, but we´d wished for a cupboard in the room to keep the luggage out of the damp bathroom. Not a big problem, though. We´d also wished for at little more seating arrangment in the room, and/or on the porch outside. A couple of chairs and a table on the porch outside the room would make a perfect private breakfast spot. During our stay we had 3-4 private yoga sessions with Wira Arimbawa. He´s a highly skilled and equally highly patient yoga teacher the staff at Kano Sari booked upon our wish for private sessions.

1200,I stayed 6 nights at the Kayon and just loved the resort. The staff and service were impeccable! They made me feel so welcome and stay very special. I booked the River Suite and was not disappointed. It was beautiful! The resort is very quiet and relaxing. They have a shuttle that can take you to the town center every hour which is a short 10-15 minute ride (depending on traffic). You can also utilize the pool at their sister resort- The Kayon Jungle. The hotel arranged for the shuttle to take me over there one afternoon and that was fabulous as well. I would definitely stay at this resort again when I return to Bali!,"July 11, 2019","21    The Kayon Resort

1202,"The first words that manager Gede spoke to us as we first arrived to the resort were ""welcome to our home"" and this place surely felt like home and more.Everything from the facilities to the rooms to the staff were excellent, and don't let me start about the customer service, everyone makes you feel like a king as they spoil you with their great service. The restaurant was top notch with the best food that i have ever ate. The pool although small but never crowded had a great view that makes you feel that you are in a tropical paradise. The rooms were very spacious and we had a great view at the river. Room service clean two times a day but they forgot to clean the coffee pot for 2 straight days but that wasn't a bother to us because the rest of the room was spotless. I definitely recommend this resort to anyone staying in ubud. Surely will come again on our next trip to bali. Lastly a special thanks to Mira, Kadek, and Diwa for their great service.

1207,"Balinese people are very hospitable, but this resort have the most hospitable people in Bali. They started us of with a very warm welcome that made us feel at home. Their welcome drink is my favorite (unfortunately, I forgot the name)! They gave us a nice tour around the resort. They showed us to our room (which was given to us a little earlier than the check in time with no extra charge). In our room, they told us the complimentary services that they have during our stay. This resort might be one of the most expensive resorts in Bali, but their comps and services are definitely worth it. The hotel provides a van that comes to the city center almost every hour. The city center is approx 15-20 mins car ride from the resort. The resort provided us with a map (Monkey forest is walking distance from the drop off area!!!) and tips on how to go to different tourist places in Ubud.The rooms are very clean. The resort is in the middle of a forest, right next to a river. There a mosquitoes around the area, but we were unbothered by them. They provide mosquito repellants to their guests. Quick tip: DO NOT BRING MOSQUITO REPELLANTS FROM USA. The mosquitoes are unfazed by those repellants. Use the ones in Indonesia or from another Southeast Asian country. Anyway, the resort does a smoking thing twice a day so the mosquitoes stay away. My favorite part of our room is the bathroom! The bathtub overlooks the river and it is definitely amazing. You can have an instagramable picture of yourself with flowers (which is complimentary, but you have to reserve 1 day before) or with bubbles (which is provided next to your tub with the shampoo). The flower set up takes some time since the workers are very meticulous on designing it. Make sure to leave a tip to these young men who sets up the room and cleans it. They do their job very well without expecting for tips (they were very surprised when we gave them one).During the welcome, we met the restaurant manager who introduced us to their food and different activities around the restaurant. We bought the special dinner for two and we do not regret it! The food is amazing. My husband is a very picky food eater, but he loves the food in this restaurant. (Example: Lamb chops is one of those hit or miss dishes. But this restaurant perfected it.)Their breakfast menu (which is included in the nightly price) provides a variety of flavor depending on your taste. They do not only have American breakfast, but they also introduce Balinese/ Indonesian breakfast. They also have complimentary afternoon tea/ coffee. They have a variety of tea selections that definitely complements the little pastries that come with it. They are also very flexible. One night, my husband was craving for fried chicken (of all dishes!). It is not part of their menu, but we asked the server if the cook can make this possible. They were very fast to tell us that they are able to make this request (which made my hubs very happy). Overall, their restaurant made our trip to Ubud an unforgettable one. We definitely recommend couples who are married, not married or rekindling their love to come and visit this very serene place. Even if you do not go out the resort, there are plenty of things that guests can do. Our trip to Ubud is for rest and relaxation and that is what we had. Young or old, this resort will make you feel at home. Thank you, Kayon. We are very grateful for your services and hospitality.","July 4, 2019","21    The Kayon Resort

1216,"My partner and I stayed 4 nights here. It became our home away from home. The employees literally said ""welcome home"" when we would return from leaving the property when going our day trips. Everything here was superb. We stayed at three locations during my holiday in Bali and the Kayon Resort was our favorite. I have zero complaints.Staff:Everyone is super nice, pleasing and personable. They make a real effort to get to know and call us by our names. Everyone treated us with care and provided excellent customer service. The service is over and beyond. One night we had our leftovers from another restaurant warmed up and delivered back to our room. No problem at all. The service alone would make me return and encourage others to stay here. I cannot speak enough about the quality of customer service.Room:We stayed in the river suite. The sound of the river and waterfall is so peaceful. It made our daily coffee on the balcony so pleasant. The view was beautiful. The room was kept clean and tidy daily and nightly. The bed is comfortable, the bathroom is very nice. All in all the room is very inviting.Pool/resort grounds:The pool is small but adequate and looks over the river and lush topography. The grounds are beautiful, romantic and peaceful. location:The resort is a bit hidden away from all the traffic and noise and this we liked. It's a close ride (shuttle provided) to the mix of things in Ubud. It's a perfect distance to provide comfort and serenity yet close enough when you want to get out and explore.Restaurants:We had breakfast every morning at the Kayon and dinner one night and lunch one day at the jetty cafe. The food was good and the presentation lovely. To sum it up, we enjoyed every minute of our stay and every aspect of the resort. If we return to Ubud, we would stay again.

He was polite and warm, and had cold towels and a bottle of water ready for us. In addition, the hotel were kind enough to arrange food for us despite us arriving extremely late in the day, at a time when the restaurant would've been closed. The staff - We found all the staff went the extra mile everyday to ensure we enjoyed our stay. They communicate very well with each other, and remember every detail from our names, activties for the day, to our dietary requirements. Everyone was so lovely, to name a few, Pinky was always so welcoming at reception, Ni luh, Dewa and Mira were attentive and efficient at every encounter at Ke Pitu restaurant, Agung was extremely helpful when we went for afternoon tea. (Apologies if I misspelt any names).Rooms - The rooms were large, spacious and clean.

In the Kayon spirit he was friendly, provided detail about history and culture which we found very interesting. I'd highly recommend the tour. It ended with a picnic at the rice terraces which was a great way to take a few moments to take in the beauty of our surroundings. The hotel also assisted with booking a downhill cycling tour with an external company which we also enjoyed.Spa - All of our treatments were excellent and extremely relaxing. We prebooked treatments to avoid dissapointment and it was so easy to do online before we even arrived. KePitu - The staff always remembered our dietary requirements and were efficient with taking our order. In particular, during breakfast they'd enquire about your activities to ensure they could serve you in good time before your activities. Basically, we loved our stay. Thank you for making our first time in Bali so memorable for us. Priyal & Rishi","June 9, 2019","21    The Kayon Resort

Very quiet and tranquil.- Spacious rooms- Did I mention the service was just amazing?Small con- Resort felt a little bit older and it shows in some features. For example, the hot water took a long time to heat up before showering.Wish I could give this a 4.5.","June 9, 2019","21    The Kayon Resort

1228,"We have been to Bali many times and thought so far that we have already experienced the maximum of the hospitality and warmth of the people experienced there.In The Kayon we could experience in 8 days that more is possible.The service there combined with Balinese friendliness is outstanding.We felt very comfortable and would like to spend our holiday there again.The resort is quietly located in a rural setting with a distinctive jungle feel. Due to the very good shuttle service to Ubud, you can escape the silence and experience Ubud.","June 8, 2019","21    The Kayon Resort

1230,"We stayed at the Kayon for 5 nights looking to unwind and enjoy the natural setting, and the whole experience couldn’t have been better.The hotel had only a few rooms, but was beautifully designed so it felt spacious and the facilities and communal areas were never too busy. The rooms were very comfortable, and the hotel seemed to have thought of everything a guest could need and provided it. The beds were super comfy and we slept so well in the wonderful peaceful surroundings. This extended to the activities on offer, twice daily yoga classes were included (not too challenging for a beginner!) and a daily walk to the village to see the rice fields and get a sense of how the locals live. The pool was small but gorgeous, just about big enough for lengths and perfect for a cooling dip with a feeling of being immersed in the jungle. The two real high points (if I could speak any more highly of the Kayon!) were the service and the food.The staff were excellent - they were friendly and so accommodating, but at the same time were always open to have a chat and a smile and tell you about themselves in a way that felt very genuine. They had obviously been picked and trained well by the hotel. It’s great the way they take trainees from the local villages. The staff knew each guest by name, and were always happy to help in any way they could.The food was delicious and so fresh. We had expected to sample a few local restaurants in Ubud, but ended up eating at the hotel every evening because the food was just so fabulous. The breakfast was amazing, generous portions of everything, fresh bread and home made jam...fresh juices... beware of potential for weight gain. The BBQ night was another highlight. My only advice to the Kayon following our stay is - please don’t change! You are perfect.","June 5, 2019","21    The Kayon Resort

1232,"My family and I had two days here, and we had such a wonderful experience at this resort that all of us were extremely sad when we were leaving the airport because everything exceeded our expectations, and we felt at home here. The staffs are extremely friendly, helpful, kind, and patient as they truly pay attention to the guests' needs. One memory that I would never forget is when the staffs taught me to wear sarong. The swimming pool and the resort's scenery are beautiful as I felt myself having a chance to merge into nature and appreciate the resources that nature has always provided us. The room is modern, convenient, and comfortable. Overall, everything here is perfect. This resort has made my vacation in Bali more memorable.","June 5, 2019","21    The Kayon Resort

1233,"I surprised my best friend by taking her here for her 30th. I’m American but live in Dubai and wanted to visit Bali for vacation. I have literally never experienced such unparalleled service. The staff were excellent, attentive, kind and incredibly thoughtful. The resort was stunning, with handcrafted details in every nook and cranny. Without even asking the staff surprised my friend with a birthday cake at the restaurant. The food at the restaurant was incredible. I’m not usually big on just repeating restaurants especially in a place like Bali But we weren’t disappointed. The chef even specially baked me gluten free bread every morning (which was delicious - Chef eddy I need that recipe!) One more detail - the resort has a waterfall and we got to watch monkeys play in the mornings by the waterfall & one morning we even woke up to them outside our balcony! Was fascinating to see the monkey family interact. A huge thanks to the staff as the beauty, unparalleled service and gorgeous location of the resort were incredible. If I come back to Bali I would come here in an instant. And would highly recommend! 10/10 from both of us.","June 5, 2019","21    The Kayon Resort

1241,"We recently visited The Kayon Resort as a part of our Honeymoon. We were lucky enough to be there for 6 nights in one of the pool villas. We arrived quite late and the staff were so friendly on our arrival. They took our bags straight down to the room and we got took on a tour of the hotel. Once arriving in the room, they showed us everything in the room and how different things worked.The resort itself is so peaceful and secluded, with a relaxing atmosphere. We stayed at our private pool most days with no interruptions or loud noises to disturb us. It was truly relaxing, just what we wanted for our honeymoon. The food in the restaurant was amazing. There was a huge choice at breakfast, varying from continental to Indonesian. You certainly will not go hungry! We ate in the restaurant every evening we stayed in the hotel. The food was always brilliant and enjoyed the atmosphere. The staff in the hotel are exceptional. Every single one of them always greeted you and asked how we were. They went out of their way to ensure you were enjoying your stay and went above and beyond to get you everything. Overall, this hotel is outstanding.

1243,"I don't usually write reviews because I'm the ""why bother"" type of person. However, if I didn't write a review for The Kayon Resort Ubud it would be a sin.Prior To Arrival:I have been in contact with the resort prior to my arrival as I was booking transfer service from the airport to the resort. We arrived late and there were delays in getting our baggage but the driver waited patiently with our names printed on a sign and he was very gracious and nice. He helped us with our luggage and we had good conversation for 1.5 hours to our resort.Arrival to the Resort:We were greeted by 3-4 staff but the first person to speak to us was Wibi. He was very welcoming, asked about our flight, assisted with our bags, and gave us some general information. It wasn't your regular guest service welcome because he was very genuine and attentive. I didn't go through any hassle with checking in and my husband and I sat comfortably in their lobby while they got all the information ready. A very lovely staff member assisted us to our room. She showed us around the facilities and escorted us to our room where she also explained the features and provided more hotel information (spa, pool, restaurant etc). What stood out was their respect for the environment. There was an ant on the table and naturally instead of flicking the ant off the table, the staff member slowly carried the ant and ensured its placement elsewhere (so much respect for the environment/animals - so refreshing to see!)Hotel:Now I know why this place is 5 stars - really, it should be more! There were beautiful flowers on our bed with a customized welcome note. On the second day after a fun filled sight seeing day - there was a flower bath awaiting us in the room.The facilities are immaculate, there is so much respect for Balinese culture throughout the resort. The cleanliness and maintenance is spectacular. This hotel is situated in the heart of the forest and the design and rooms really utilize the beauty of the trees and it's gorgeous waterfall perfectly. We rented the hotel scooter and took the car shuttle to Ubud market (by the way, their shuttle even has Wi-Fi!). It was easy process and staff ensured our safety.Our room was situated with the flowing river below so you can hear the river from inside the room or on the balcony - so magical.Staff:Every staff member is so nice! Each person remembered our names and greeted you as if you were family. I remember Agung who was leaving the hotel and we were coming back from the market. He was already off his shift but he insisted on carrying our bags to the lobby.Every staff was so knowledgeable about the area and recommended restaurants or places to visit. Each staff member ensured our needs were met. When we would change our schedule, they were very accommodating.What really stood out was when we left at 7am for day trips, they would provide/pack boxes of croissants/Danish and water bottles for us. When we left for 2am trekking to mount batur - they provided us with fruits, water, and hard boiled eggs (amazing!).We met Gede who was the Resort Manager who was incredibly nice and welcoming - apparently he was trying to catch us for a few days. He left a note in our room and because of our long stay, offered a complimentary dinner at their incredible restaurant. It was a lovely dinner - a perfect night for my husband and I.I recommend this resort to every one! Thank you Kayon Resort Ubud for making our honeymoon the most memorable experience. Many blessings to each person at Kayon!Terimakasih","May 22, 2019","21    The Kayon Resort

1246,"The Kayon Resort was our second hotel we stayed during our honeymoon in Bali. From arrival we were welcomed with a flower garland and flower for behind our ear. Check in was smooth and easy and we were taken to the hotel sign with a silver umbrella “for king and queens” for a welcome photo. The reception staff then escorted us to the restaurant overlooking the infinity pool which was out of this world. We received a welcome drink which was so delicious and the staff offered us lunch. The staff were all so kind and friendly at all times, nothing was too much trouble. The hotel has no escalators which was actually very refreshing and made the walk down to our villa (villa 5) even more exciting. When staff opened the lock on our door and allowed us to enter we was greeted by our private infinity pool overlooking the river where we could here the waterfall flowing. The decking, pool and sun loungers were so clean. We was then shown into our villa where the bed was decorated in the honeymoon decoration and a lovely welcome scroll and card from management congratulating us in our honeymoon. In our villa we had a glass wall which showed the continuation of the love story carved in the wall on the walk down the hotel towards the canon jetty. We thought this was a lovely touch as they have installed a light into this to show it throughout the night. There was mosquito netting around the bed. We was provided with a daily replenished fruit basket that included not just your normal fruit but Balinese fruit too which was a lovely touch. We was guided around the room by the hotel staff and then she explained about the Ubud shuttle bus and different facilities around the hotel. We was provided with a free bookmark and bag as well as postcards to send home to our family making them all jealous. In the bathroom there was a hairdryer, iron, ironing board, the coffee and tea making facilities and the most beautiful bath and shower. The bath was decorated in flowers on our arrival which added such a lovely touch to the already beautiful room. The bath was against a huge window that overlooked the jungle which was so relaxing and lush. The hotel provide a mosquito spray protector and also a plug in. My husband got bitten quite badly in Bali and the hotel staff offered to completely change all our bedding and towels in the room just incase it was anything in there which was so nice of them. Our first night we ate out which was arranged before our trip to Bali. The staff were happy to provide us with a taxi to this restaurant and also offered to arrange a taxi home for us which was lovely. During our second day we spent time in the main pool with some cocktails and food before going for afternoon tea on the cannon jetty with the waterfall in the background and spending the evening in our private pool. We then had a candlelight dinner as part of our honeymoon package. The food was absolutely out of this world. Our host Adguce was a trainee at the hotel at the time but you would never know. He was amazing with us and explained each of the courses perfectly. He also helped us choose which wine to have which we had the HATTEN aga red (highly recommended by us) the food was cooked to perfection. The decoration was so romantic with flower petals, candles and a huge heart full of candles. The experience was a memory we will have for a lifetime. On our final day we had a couples Balinese massage at the hotel spa which was so relaxing. The room was beautiful and had big glass windows overlooking the jungle. The spa staff were so friendly and asked lots of questions on whether we had any areas we would like them to focus more on. They provided 3 different oils which we could choose which one we wanted the massage completed in. They suggested the lavender oil for my husband to help with his bites and I chose the lemongrass. The staff was very professional throughout the entire massage. On our final day the Kayon resort offered to transfer us to our next hotel using their air conditioned car which was so lovely. They all lines in a row to wave goodbye to us on our departure and offered us sparkling water to take on our journey to seminyak. Thank you so much to all of you at the kayon resort.

Apologies for not remembering their names. The setting was amazing, you’re right in the middle of a jungle and next to a waterfall. If you’re lucky, you can catch a glimpse of monkeys swinging in the trees! We spent one day going to the Tegunungan, the rice fields, and Mount Batur. Kadek was our private driver and he was so friendly and flexible. Little things like having a cooler (with cold water and towels) in the private SUV were very much appreciated. Breakfast at the Kepitu restaurant was outstanding. You could skip lunch because it was just too much food! The hourly shuttle to Ubud was very convenient. Our room was great - the bed was very comfortable, the strong AC was a relief from the overwhelming heat and humidity outside, the zen-inspired bathroom was clean and spacious. A funny thing happened on our last day - we got a call from front desk informing us that our check-out date was not that day but the day after. We were chatting with housekeeping and the housekeeping manager earlier and had told them we were checking out that morning. They must have informed front desk who immediately called us. Turned out I was mistaken:) We were so happy - who wouldn't want to spend another day at this amazing hotel!","May 15, 2019","21    The Kayon Resort

They handle complaints really well however complaining about The f & b seemsLike a lost cause. I feel really sorry for The Waiters / waitresses. They are doing their Utmost but kitchen needs to be trained as well. Mail courses never came together. While My friend finished i didnt Even get mine yet. And This just didnt happen once. IT also took soooooo long for our lunch. Fries were cold. I amStill in The hotelRight now. Waiting for French Fries which i ordered about 45 min ago. The f&b outlets need to be trained in so many ways. Such a shame for such a lovely hotel. We Will not be eating here anymore as iT just takes too long.

And also the kids corner, they are super friendly too! My kids love the resort stay so much that they wanted to come back again. Pro:Far from noisy area like Kuta, peaceful and nice beach, some restaurants and massage is in walking distance or you can took a taxi to nearby restaurant. You are spoil with choices. Room facing sea is spacious, clean, and the bed is comfortable, good water pressure for shower. (Do note that this room will get a bit noisy if there is any function near the pool. The inconsiderate guest continue to party and talking loudly till 12 even I think the function end at 10pm)Kids below 12 eat for free when u order a main course from the menu. (We ordered porridge due to my wife no feeling well and porridge is not in the menu. Thinking that it's a main course and the waiter also did not highlight to us. Was shock when we make the payment, because our kids meal is charge in the bill :( ) Kids corner is fun for my two little monkey. Full of activities available for my kids, they love the cookies making session!Beach is clean.Breakfast is yummy, Pasar Market Restaurant food is also yummy. Love the Pizza! Burger! Fried noodle.Two thumbs up to the hotel Frontline stuff. All are hardworking and always greet you with a smile.Con:Room facing main road is noisy, I don't think they can do anything about it.Pool water is cold. Especially the inner pool.Kids pool water bucket is under maintenance, only one slide. My kids get bored after few try, maybe they can create more waterplay.Overall, it's a full star resort with some room of improvement. We definitely will be back again!

From check in everything was perfect, 5 star customer service, super easy check in and that entrance atrium is amazing!Our room was stunning! We were upgraded to ‘partial beach view’ but our room had FULL beach view. The shower and bathroom are marble and similar to staying in a 6 star resort. The bed was super comfortable and loved the pillow menu.We didn’t have kids with us but it’s definitely a kids paradise still with lots of area for adults to chill out also. Only area for improvement was the Nudi Bar management. The bar attendants are very green (maybe still in training), not very attentive and seemed very overwhelmed all day with orders. It was a long wait for drinks/food with our friends order being lost completely. The Balinese themed dinner was excellent, breakfast was the best we’ve ever had in our lives! Such a huge selection and well cooked! Just be careful you get down early, they seem to start packing away breakfast at 10.15am for a 10.30am close.You have an array of water sports right out front of the resort... for couples there is a luxury bar with tapas on the beach right next door to holiday inn with fast service and great cocktails (free tapas during happy hour, you must try the squid chilli jam) at the Priya Villas on beach- well worth the 10 metre walk!We will definitely be back to Holiday Inn, loved every moment xxx ","June 29, 2019","22    Holiday Inn Resort Bali Benoa

1255,We booked one of their atrium pool access room and it was really convenient as the swimming pool just outside the room. Very friendly staff and they have lovely play room for the children. We order room service a few times and the food was just ok nothing great. Lots of choices for the buffet breakfast. The beach is nice and clean.

1256,its a nice hotel with a good location and good amenities. Stayed with family for 3 nights. The room was spacious and clean. The food was average. Breakfast had a lot of variety. The only problem - all the plates smelled of egg. For vegetarian people that might be an issue. Best part - kids eat for free! The beach area is small but well kept. The beach itself has sea weed growth so no great surf.,"June 26, 2019","22    Holiday Inn Resort Bali Benoa

1257,"We recently stayed 6 nights at the Holiday Inn Tanjung Benoa. The hotel met all our needs and was very clean and well maintained. The greatest asset to this hotel are the staff who were very friendly and went out of their way to help out whenever they could. When we arrived at the hotel our son wasn't feeling well so Juli at reception did her very best to check us in a bit early and let us use the departure lounge until the room was ready :) The staff at the entrance were friendly and would always ask how we were and what our plans were. Even the security staff would help you get across the road if the traffic was heavy.I need to say a special 'shout out' to Sugi for his fruit carving expertise when my daughter joined the class on the activity schedule, not only is he talented but he also was great to talk to !!!The only thing that may be lacking is things for older children to do, you could see they have a fantastic kids club for younger children but not so much for 12 and 14 year olds. The food and beverage quality was very good and the prices were reasonable so we found we ate in the hotel a few evenings. The breakfast buffet was amazing we found heaps of choice and it was very well run by all the staff...loved being able to get a freshly made latte coffee each morning :)","June 11, 2019","22    Holiday Inn Resort Bali Benoa

1258,"We recently stayed in this hotel for 6 nights, 5 days as a holiday package promotion of an Aussie airline. We are so happy we chose this hotel, especially that that was our first time to visit Bali. Its location is perfect for those who like some peace, relaxation and fun with your family, away from the hustle and bustle of Kuta and Seminyak. We loved the pool and the beach, the breakfast buffet, and the cleanliness of the room and hotel amenities. Most of all, we were so impressed with the service. The staff were so warm, friendly, helpful and super attentive to our needs. We actually miss the hotel than Bali itself because of our great experience there. We will highly recommend it to our friends and family who will visit Bali soon.","June 5, 2019","22    Holiday Inn Resort Bali Benoa

1260,"We spent 2 weeks at this resort on Benoa Beach, Bali. We absolutely loved it. First and foremost, a huge shout out to the fantastic employees of the hotel. Every single person working at the hotel, no matter in what capacity, was friendly, always smiling, always concerned about your well being, always checking how they could help us, do more for us, really anything. They were there to please the guests and that they certainly did over and over again. Without hesitation I can say that the employees went above and beyond everyday and did so willingly and without hesitation. The best employees of any hotel we have ever stayed in, anywhere in the world!!!We upgraded our room to an ocean view. The room was very comfortable, nice size bathroom, great shower, lovely queen size bed with both soft and firm pillows, nice patio with 2 chairs and a small table. Adequate toiletries in the bathroom. During the two weeks we stayed, I would have loved it if the floor was washed and the windows cleaned. That's my only small complaint.The main restaurant in the hotel had both indoor and outdoor seating and a daily buffet breakfast was included. There was a big selection of food and beverages to choose from, all delicious. I would have liked the hot food to be hotter though. Eggs could be made to order. Again, the restaurant staff were fantastic. The restaurant was open for breakfast, lunch and dinner.There was a swim up pool bar which also had seating available out of the pool for refreshments and food.The swimming pool was very large with three areas. One pool area was inside the hotel but was open air, the other two areas, were outside in the open. Clean beach towels were available everyday. There was plenty of balls and such available for children. There was also a supervised, dedicated playroom for children.The actual beach area had lots of sun lounges. We did not use the beach as we didn't care for the gritty sand and the loads of seaweed in the water as well as occasional garbage item. The tide would go out for hours on end and when this occurred during the day there was no water to swim in. Water sports such as sea-doos could only be used when the tide was in.","June 2, 2019","22    Holiday Inn Resort Bali Benoa

1261,"We stayed for 4 nights at Holiday Inn Resort at Benoa , Bali for 4 nights for our family vacation . Firstly the resort is located in a strip of road next to Beach with everything closeby for daily needs . The road is lined up with many beach resorts and one can choose from multiple places to eat with easy access. The location is excellent and with easy access to beach it’s just heaven . This area is famous for its water sports so a big plus if one wants to explore that as well. Now coming to resort , it’s mostly like a 4.5 star resort with nice clean and modern rooms . Breakfast spread is vast and a big plus . Nudi beach bar at Resort is a very chilled out and relaxing place for a drink in the evening by the sea . It has happy hours daily from 4 to 6pm and then from 10 to midnight , so you get one free drink as bonus . Overall many activities for small kids but slightly bigger kids will feel bored there . Room service is nice and staff is very friendly but that’s every where in Bali where people are overly friendly and welcoming towards tourists. I would recommend this resort as it’s in a lovely beach facing location and with everything easily accessible closeby including laundry which is much cheaper outside . Getting cabs outside hotel is like so easy and one need not wait for even 5 minutes for that , again a big plus .","June 2, 2019","22    Holiday Inn Resort Bali Benoa

The room was clean and bed was very comfortable with a modern bathroom and a furnished balcony. The sound of the gentle ocean waves (this area has a natural barrier a few hundred meters out) and cool breeze made it an extra relaxing experience whether on the sun beds on the beach, the balcony or the bedroom.The photo session by Stamp produced some very good photos and while you get one free print, Stamp was such a good photographer that we purchased eleven digital images :) We throughly enjoyed our stay and would be happy to recommend it to family and friends.

1266,"There is a place in this world, where tradition is lived, not just respected. Come to Bali, if you want to see tradition in action. In the land of Small Gods, people are super nice and superstitious. Be careful where you tread, so that you do not step on the homage for the local spirit. Respect the local beliefs. Try arak and enjoy the time of your life diving, snorkeling or otherwise experiencing Bali and its diverse nature, delicious local cuisine and vivid culture. Say „matur suksama“ with a small bow and the marvels of local kindness will be yours to savior. I stayed in the very family friendly (and reasonably priced) Holiday Inn Resort and that proved a wonderful starting point for my spa and culinary explorations. I will do my best to come here again and find out more about the land of the Small Gods.","May 2, 2019","22    Holiday Inn Resort Bali Benoa

1267,"The resort is set up awesome for kids and there are plenty of activities for them to enjoy , from the awesome kids club to the 3 swimming pools.The food is also very good, especially the pizza it is excellent, and made really well. The staff are always friendly and more than helpful to any of your needs , with nothing being to much trouble.We would highly recommend , especially for a family holiday, our daughter had a excellent time at the resort. And we would not hesitate to return.One more mention would be the spa( tea tree spa) it is great, myself and my wife agree that is probably the best masage we have had at a resort in Bali and we have been to quite a few different ones. The treatments on offer are quite well priced and the masages are great.In conclusion the service is great at the resort, also the food is good and really well priced, and kids eat free when you order a main course. So all in all highly recommend.The only thing I would say is we had a pool access room which was very nice, and had direct access into the atrium pool which is quite shaded but does get some sun as day goes on, but we found the pool to cold to swim in, and only used this pool twice for 10mins each time , in the week we stayed.It wasn’t a problem for us we used the main pool everyday which gets nice a warm in the sun. You also have the direct beach access with sun loungers on beach which is very nice also, and there are plenty of staff and security around all the time.Thankyou holiday inn, benoa for a great week, we will definitely be back.","May 1, 2019","22    Holiday Inn Resort Bali Benoa

1268,"It’s hard to write an analytical review on this property, as it’s the staff that make the stay world class. There are so many lovely people that work at the Holiday Inn Bali Benoa that I would insult too many if I were to not mention their names… Ritni the front office manager, Juni and Christian at guest services, each and every one of the 20 odd people we spoke to whilst dining, and literally EVERY single employee deserve to be congratulated for making guests feel welcome. Holiday Inn Resort Bali Benoa is located in a family friendly, thus less raucous region of Bali. The resort is tucked in between the Conrad to the North, and a posh Royal Santrian all-villa resort to the South. A few minutes’ walk further south you'll find the big-name luxury resorts like Melia, Westin, Sofitel, Club Med and Laguna.This property has created a niche market for itself. An affordable yet decent beach resort plugged between the costlier mega properties around it. The property does not have the expansive lawns as does its 2 neighbours, but I don’t think you need that in Bali, as you could freely walk along the promenade and day-visit any of the surrounding properties in Nusa Dua. Nusa Dua will always be the area I'd want to stay when in Bali, and at the price of this Holiday Inns accommodations it's certainly a very good option. Our family of 4 had a Tanjung Kids Adventure Suite which offers a separate ""room"" with a bunk-bead, beanbags, TV and Playstation for the kids. This was great as it gave the little people their own space. The only negative to this particular room category is that it faces the road, and only has the slightest sea view. The grandparents had a partial sea view King room though, and this would also have been perfect for us had we not taken the kids along.The resort itself is a Holiday Inn through and through. You know what you’re going to get, as a Holiday Inn Resort anywhere in the world is going to be exactly the same as any other one anywhere else in the world! The Hotel only opened in 2015, so it still feels new and fresh. I do feel that the hotel is kind of squeezed in on a narrower lot between its neighbours, thus necessitating a rectangular building. The pool / pools however flow pretty much the whole length of the inner section, so there’s loads of cooling down areas! If there is one thing I have to fault the resort on, it’s the F&B department. NOT the Food though, but the delivery of it. We spent 10 nights at the resort, and on most occasions, food took quite long to reach us, and most times if we ordered drinks at the same time, then both the drinks and meals would arrive a good 30 to 40 minutes later. Having said this, I have never stayed in a hotel anywhere in the world where staff at all levels were more accommodating, and more eager to please. Eg, I ordered a Caesar Salad which comes with optional Satay Chicken. I asked them to change the satay to grilled chicken instead, and the waiter did not even question the request. He next day I’d request some other off-menu item, and that too would be very happily arranged.Bottom line: It’s a Holiday Inn. If you want the Ritz, then pay for the Ritz. Holiday Inns are great value resorts, and this particular property will remain a favorite for me with a big family outing, as the staff really just are so great.","April 25, 2019","22    Holiday Inn Resort Bali Benoa

1270,"We went on a family trip to Bali (2 seniors, 2 Adults, 1 child-6Y) for a week, and this hotel had something for everyone. Location of Nusa Dua is apt for the families, it has ample of good hotels, supermarkets, diners, good beaches, and water sports - at the same time happening places such as Kuta/Seminyak, and Jimbaran are 20-30 minutes car ride away. The room was spacious, and had a balcony with view of the sea. Breakfast spread was sumptuous, with variety of continental and Asian options. We usually headed to the pool/beach by the morning, and remained there till 5pm - enjoying drinks at the beach/pool restaurant and water activities, the day ended up having dinner at a seafood restaurant at Jimbaran or at nearby restaurants. The kids club is a hit, our daughter had so much fun just due to the kids club - it had a play area, lots of activities, TV, and caretakers to look after - kudos to them. We refrained from taking day trips, however, headed to Ubud for 1 day - it was a good experience of the Balinese culture and handicraft. The hotel staff is very friendly and caring - they all greeted with a smile (I remember having great chats with Ayuni and Widhi at the Nudi bar). An authorised money exchange is just opposite the hotel within the supermarket. Local handicraft shops are close by - don’t forget to bargain. Indian restaurants are also within 5-7 minutes walking distance - meals at the hotel are great too.","April 14, 2019","22    Holiday Inn Resort Bali Benoa

I must say that this hotel was beautiful and pay attentions to cleanliness, convenience, safety and security.The food was also very tasty. The breakfast was complete. They provided since traditional, continental, American and English breakfast. But the most impressive was the kid's corner. Very attentive.They also have this beautiful pool including one kid's pool with a big bucket shower and slide.They emphasize their family resort by providing kids play. There were like four attendants would take care of your kids. And this facility is safe and free. Once you registered you would be asked to be photo taken.For you who like spa, they also have one with good therapist like Juni. She was very polite and attentive also communicative. One last thing which was good although for smoker like me. They only have three smoking area which were near the beach, one is near the bar and another one was in the drop off area.There were some staffs who gave me beautiful stay impressions, they were the drivers who picked me up and drive me to airport, Onix the guest relations, Ayuni who always welcome me when I had breakfast and that guy in the photo leisure counter, also those two guys who gave me turn down service.

The staff were very welcoming and easy to deal with. We have stayed in Tanjung Benoa a couple of times previously and would say that this is a little bit far from the main restaurants. However that said, there are plenty of options around the hotel to get food and convenience items. The breakfast selection is very good and changed daily offering good variety across our 6 day stay. The rooms were spacious, well appointed with excellent air-conditioning. The kids club was great and the staff lovely. While the pools only have a maximum depth of 120cm, they were extensive with plenty of shade. When I lost my sunglasses, the staff went out of their way to find them - eventually locating them following an inadvertent theft by a 3 year old child. The front desk were also very helpful in scanning some documents for me. The negative of this property is that the number of pool chairs is completely disproportionate to the number of rooms. Although we were there during a quiet period, the number of chairs around the pool is completely inadequate. Otherwise, this a good, solid option for an affordable family holiday.","February 28, 2019","22    Holiday Inn Resort Bali Benoa

1283,"I stayed with family and friends at this wonderful resort a few weeks ago. And can’t wait to go back. The resort, being new, has been well planned out with bright and fresh furnishings. We all stayed in the pool access rooms, having our own pool lounges, deck (where we played cards) and stairs into one of the four pools (with own swim-up pool bar). The staff are a real asset too. The first morning at breakfast a staff member realised we were new and asked if we had any dietary requirements. I’m a vegetarian so she walked me through the vegetarian section and offered to make a suitable rice / noodle dish going forward (I was to give notice the previous day). I have never experienced this before so was very impressed. Also impressive is egg ordering, on each table is an order sheet where one can choose 1-2-3 egg scrambled, poached, boiled or omelettes (with fillings). Hand it to the staff member and they deliver once cooked. Again with it being a new resort, the air-conditioned restaurant was welcomed (I’ve stayed in many resorts with breakfast room outdoors). Those who wish to sit outside are catered for too. The lunch and dinner food options were plenty and tasty. The Nudi Bar / Restaurant is well set-up too, it is sunken so you can be at the same height as people swimming. Along one side is a table-top which swimmers can use when eating and drinking (sitting on in-built pool stools). As can happen at any hotel, we did experience a problem with one of the rooms (pipe leaked in ceiling) but they quickly got engineers in to investigate. Unfortunately it wasn’t fixed the first time so they relocated one of our rooms to an upstairs suite. It wasn’t ideal as our rooms were interconnecting but we made do as only two nights remaining. Manager Regan was quick to come up with solutions to make it of little inconvenience to us. I do have to mention the bathrooms (in rooms) have frosted window along shower and door to bathroom (which afforded little privacy when both on toilet and in shower). We ended up showering in the dark (I was staying with a niece). Can I please suggest you make these minor changes. Overall, we all HIGHLY recommend this resort. 5 OUT OF 5. Please pass our thanks onto the people we didn’t see before leaving: housekeeping, restaurant staff, grounds cleaners, pool cleaners; towel keepers. See you next Christmas","February 6, 2019","22    Holiday Inn Resort Bali Benoa

1284,Air conditioning isn't cold. We left the room with all doors closed and set the air conditioning to it's lowest setting (20 degrees celcius) and came back 4 hours later to find it not cooled.The water that is used in the shower has smell of chlorine and people with sensitive skin should be aware of this.The bed is comfortable and the hotel does provide 2 choices of pillows (soft and firm).The location is a little quiet and there isn't much of the local flare and travelling to the central city area is abit far.

They go out o fthe way to keep kids entertained, and to entice families to eat in their in-house restaurants, they offer a kids eat free plan - wherein if you order a starter and main course from main menu, one chilld gets a free meal of starter+ main course+ dessert from the kids menuThe thing that really stands out is the service and hospitality.

Breakfast provided an excellent selection and the staff (Special mention to Dika) made us feel very special each morning.The beach, whilst not necessarily the best in Bali, provided all watersport opportunities.There were plenty of good restaurants and massage spas nearby.Children are also very well catered for with a great kids pool and other facilities.Go to the Holiday Inn Bali Benoa - you will not be disappointed.","December 28, 2018","22    Holiday Inn Resort Bali Benoa

1290,"We stayed at this property for 9 nights. Over all, our stay was great. The staff is very caring, kind and all of our requests were promptly taken care of. The property has 4 swimming pools and they are great. They have lots of islands and 2 whirlpool areas. The resort is not that big so there is always space in the pool and beach beds are always available.We have a 17 month old with us and he enjoyed running around. I wish the resort was bigger for him.The negative : Theme dinners around the holidays. We went to the Balinese night and it was a huge let down. It was quite expensive for Bali standards (600k rupiah) for 2. The food selection was very limited. They had 6 dishes, 2 veggie dishes, a soup and a small selection of sweets. The suckling pig was the star, Balinese specialty. It was OK but for the price I expected more.The breakfast, however, is good. The food selection is decent. The rooms were really nice. Clean, nice size balcony, good view. Good selection of foreign TV channels. Overall, good little family resort. However, if you care about food, I recommend Novotel up the road. We stayed there before and while Holiday Inn is nicer and more private, Novotel's food blows Holiday Inn out of the water. Their Balinese night had over 20 dishes, deserts, live band and a performance. So, stay away from Theme nights and you will enjoy your stay.","December 25, 2018","22    Holiday Inn Resort Bali Benoa

Late check out etc. Staff were so welcoming and polite, great breakfasts/selection, happy hour sundowners on the beach. A birthday cake was given as I celebrated here too. We ate in a couple of nights, delish seafood bbq and Italian buffet. All very good. Room service brought us fresh milk in a jug each morning to make a coffee and a bucket of ice each evening for our G + T's. The pools we're lovely and spotless, water aerobics was a laugh. Little shops nearby to have a nosey and bikes to hire and ride along the promenade at the rear of the hotel. Only disappointment was despite agreeing a late check out our room key function wasn't extended so we were slightly rushed leaving, plus the taxi we pre booked via reception had been forgotten too.

The hotel isnt situated in a busy part of the island and there really isnt much to do outside of the resort, but at the hotel there is more than enough to pick from.

The food at Candi is also very lovely. whilst staying here me and my partner enjoyed a couples massage together which was perfect and received the best treatment.

1307,"This property is stunning. It is lovely beyond lovely. The grounds are meticulously kept, the rooms are gorgeous, and the restaurants and their staff are delightful. However, there is SUCH a lack of WARMTH from the front desk staff and the administrative folks that it is shocking, especially considering the warmth of the Balinese people and my experiences in other hotels in Bali. I travel to Bali annually and stay all around the island for 4 weeks at a time. I stay in about 6 or 7 hotels over that time so have a good sample of hospitality on the island. This is my first stay at Candi Beach Resort and I am not sure yet if I will return. The Villa was lovely, but some details were missed - the curtains were not installed around our outdoor day bed though most other villas had them, the private pool was not cleaned daily (gosh that sounds bratty - but we did pay for it, you know). Then again there were lovely details included like afternoon tea brought to the villa, laundry delivered in a sustainable box and not plastic, and a terrific sustainability/eco program. We stayed in a Villa, the highest accommodation level. I had some email questions before arriving about booking the spa and some other services and the staff failed to get back to me - I had to follow up multiple times. Then they got a bit defensive in their tone. I asked about whether I should reserve the spa in advance of our trip or if we could get in right away when we checked in. All they did was send me the spa menu. Of course when we checked in, there was very little available and we could not book the spa experience we wanted. We witnessed at least three other couples with the same issue, trying to book and being told nothing was available during their stay (And they replied in a disappointed tone that management told them it would be no problem to reserve when they arrived), so it was not just our bad luck. Seems to me the hotel could do better in creating a process. We had a number of other issues with some checkout requests and an adjustment to one of our activities and while the front desk eventually sorted it out, it took at least 3 phone calls or stops at the front desk each time we had a query, being put on hold, being transferred to multiple people etc - for very simple and basic requests. The language was not a barrier and I also speak quite a bit of the local language myself. If this hotel would like to charge the high end prices that they do (they certainly have high end decor and property) they should work on training their management staff to behave accordingly. The property employees, however, are SO warm and kind - from servers to housekeeping to cooks every person is a delightful and kind human. We took the cooking class by the sea and had the absolute BEST time and highly recommend that. Absolutely. The staff and chef were wonderful and we loved it! THEY are the reason (along with the stunning property) that I give it such a high rating. If it was on management alone I would never stay here again EVER.Visitors should also know that this IS Bali - there will be an occasional lizard or bug in your room. The indoors is the outdoors in many ways - even in the high end villas. We had quite a few cicak lizards and such, but that is the way. There WAS a monkey and her baby on our patio who hissed whenever we went out there for a while. We let the staff know and the woman at the front desk, in a bored tone, blandly asked ""well is it still there now?"" (as if I was going to go out and check on the angry monkey at that moment when it had just lunged at me). I did not want them to do anything - and told them so - but wanted THEIR staff to know so they did not get an angry mama monkey lunging at them. Oh well. I absolutely hated interacting with their front desk completely. So bland and indifferent and quite rude, really. We want to return with our kids next year (this one was kid free), but are still undecided. Love the property, don't love the management. GO for the property, but know that if you need assistance it will be an irritating hassle - or at least you will be made to FEEL that you are irritating.","June 20, 2019","23    Candi Beach Resort & Spa

There is not much around the hotel, so it might be ill suited for travellers who look for Kuta-style activities and vibrations. The resort offers everything for a calm and relaxed holiday. Its close to the beach and has several pools. The 3 restaurants offer enough choice for different preferences. The staff is friendly and makes your stay a very relaxing experience. On our first evening we had the romatic dinner on the rooftop. Just great. Awesoem food and very nice decoration, although the strong winds were a big challenge for the organization. If you are lucky and the weather is not hazy you can even grab a good view of Mount Agung.","June 10, 2019","23    Candi Beach Resort & Spa

1310,"My husband and I stayed in one of their villas for 3 nights. The villa was really nice and looks just like the photos. Note, you will get bugs in your room but that's par for the course in Bali. The resort grounds are well maintained and the rooms were tidy. We also did a couples massage, which was nice and fairly inexpensive (I think $100 US for the two of us). My biggest complaint is the area itself and their restaurants. There isn't really a beach you can walk on, especially if the tide is high, which it was pretty much the entire time. Moreover, the ocean and beach is polluted so you can't get into the water without stepping on or swimming among the trash. Know that the resort is a bit of a compound and the nearby town doesn't offer much.That said, we ate most of our meals at one of the 3 resort's restaurants. Food was fine, nothing special or worthy of note; however, both my husband and I got sick (and on two different days). Note that when you get sick in Bali, it also lasts for 3-5 days and it's not fun. I think it was the prawns but it's hard to say for sure. We told the front desk but they didn't care one bit. Not impressed, especially for a ""luxury"" resort. Nor am I confident that they will do anything about it. We also had to wait until actual check in time for our room, which was a little irritating since they didn't take our bags, just left them sitting on a bench in the lobby, so we opted to stay with them and wait. It was more baffling since the resort wasn't full either. Overall service was good and everyone was polite, just wasn't impressed with the front desk staff. Bottom line, it's like a faux luxury resort. They charge the price of a luxury resort but had a few missteps compared to normal westernized resorts. It's fine but we stayed at much better places for less or about the same price elsewhere on the island and on the neighboring islands (the latter of which is a MUST). We actually regretted staying for more than 2 nights, which would have been plenty to have the experience of a villa near to the beach.","June 7, 2019","23    Candi Beach Resort & Spa

1311,"My husband & I have just returned from 2 weeks in a luxury pool villa, the best way to describe our holiday is FANTASTIC. From the first day to the last it was just superb, all the staff from gardening & maintenance to management could not have been friendlier. The luxury pool villa is just that..... LUXURY, having our own pool was brilliant. It was so quiet & relaxing, our villa was so private. It was my husbands birthday whilst we were away the restaurant staff presented him with a birthday cake very nice touch. The food in the restaurants is such a high quality & all the restaurant staff were so friendly & obliging. We have travelled to many places & have never had a more substantial all inclusive package (normally certain restaurants are extra & in room mini bars are extra) not at Candi Beach. The provision of proper flip flops for round the pool & slippers & gown for inside the villa was such a nice touch. Another lovely surprise was that around 15:30 daily the doorbell would ring & afternoon tea, coffee, cakes & fruit were brought daily........brilliant. We will definitely be visiting again.","June 2, 2019","23    Candi Beach Resort & Spa

1315,"The ocean view from my balcony sofa where i'm writing this lengthy review, is simply fantastic!. One can simply doze off listening to the sound of the waves crushes the shores. We were riding from the city the day before, initially made a stop here only for a drink, and then everything in this hotel felt sooo right that we decided to stay. This is a new suite, the layout, the bed, the color scheme, feels fresh, airy and bright, with such an expensive ocean view from the balcony. The suites have private parking area and more personalized reception. The suite itself is equipped with all essentials that we need for an unplanned stay. More than enough amenities, we love that they all packaged in paper wrap instead of plastic packaging, nicely arranged in a flat rattan basket. I smiled when i found among them are two small rubber band for hair. Oh how thoughtful!. Unlike other hotel, there provide 2 pairs of proper flip flops alongside the usual sleepers, also 2 complimentary beach sarong. After having drink at BIRU and delicious pizza at BASIL in the afternoon, our dinner at OCEAN TERRACE was equally enjoyable. The tuna was cooked exactly the way we wanted, and the cardamon chicken was tender and has subtle taste, not overpowering. The buffet breakfast at the same spot this morning was easy. They may not have extensive breakfast buffet items, but we were satisfied because each food that we had was all tasty.","May 19, 2019","23    Candi Beach Resort & Spa

1316,"My partner and I just spent 4 nights in a luxury pool villa. This was by far the most amazing, luxurious (and private) villa we have stayed in. The private pool and cabana is simply sensational. The room is extremely generous in size with a very comfortable super king bed and a large day bed. The huge separate bathroom has a spa and a covered outdoor double shower. The staff at the hotel were the friendliest, most attentive hotel staff I have experienced. Nothing was too much trouble. The grounds of the hotel are lush and very well maintained. Breakfast, which is a la carte for villa guests, was lovely and the pool snacks which were delivered to the villa were delicious; however the evening meals at the restaurant were just okay. We were a little tentative about travelling to Candidasa, having always stayed in Seminyak and while there is very little to see or do in the town, it wasn’t a problem as the villa was so fabulous we didn’t want to leave it. We will definitely return as soon as possible. It is truly paradise.","May 5, 2019","23    Candi Beach Resort & Spa

1318,"Candi Beach Resort was absolutely stunning!! We stayed in the Luxury Ocean View Suite and one of the most amazing aspects was the location of this hotel being right on the beach. The view from our private balcony was absolutely incredible (photos attached). We were often able to watch the sun rise and set right from our own balcony which was one of our favorite things to do! The beautiful location and views are what made us want to book this resort, however, everything about it ended up being perfect. The staff are all incredibly kind, the food and drinks at the 2 restaurants are great, and they also have a great tour booking crew right in their lobby which was a huge plus for us. Right through the hotel, we booked a bunch of tours including hiking Mount Batur and a Day in Nusa Penida. Each tour we went on, we were accompanied by an amazing and informative guide! Although this resort may have been a bit further away from some popular cities and sites than other resorts (we actually wanted a more secluded resort!), it was still just a car ride away from everything! Overall, I loved everything about this resort and our vacation here, and would definitely love to return one day!","April 7, 2019","23    Candi Beach Resort & Spa

And there are good cheap restaurants and small shops within walking distance. I would recommend this place as a relaxing sea holiday.And I would also suggest to sell crisps (crackers) by the pool.

I picked this places based off of the glowing reviews and decided to treat myself to a suite room facing the ocean. The room happened to be right above the hotel bar which plays music every night and has people sit outside all day. The balcony doors are very thin glass so it was very loud. The staff was very accommodating, showing me various rooms and even offing me a private villa to stay in for the same price. I opted for a lower room so I could still have an ocean view. I was also a little disappointed with the food. I ordered the Wagyu steak and it was tough stringy and looked almost like a meatloaf. It was very strange so I questioned the staff about it and the brought me the fillet which looked like a strip steak with the color of pork. Other than that the beach/pool were nice and staff was friendly and tried to be accommodating.

Since entering the room for the 1st time I have noticed cracks on the walls, stains on the bed curtains, window curtains and overall was disappointed after spending my first 30 minutes of presence in this hotel. When I have entered the washroom and could notice that it is not being properly washed either. The worst thing is that now I have a strange pappiloma on my hip that appeared there the next day after I took shower in my room. So the washroom is lacking a lot of proper cleaning and disinfecting. There were some informative booklets on the desk, but they were covered with the little pieces of ceiling coating, and they were falling of every day on anything I put there.The only positive thing is marvellous breakfast that you can have when enjoying a fantastic view!The prices at the diving club and the tour agency opposite to the reception are ridiculous!Was not pleased with the service either, 10000 IDR were taken upon check in, but regardless of that the amount is very small, I was never told about this deposit before coming to the hotel.

1336,"I have stayed in 2 - 5 star hotel but never have bad experience like it.Bad experience:1. When we arrived at the hotel by car, hotel staff told me to park my car. After I park my car, another staff come and told me to move my car a little bit to the front. So I came back to my car, and move it. Than when I unload my luggages, no staff came to help me. We brought many luggages because we travel with children and brought our own snorkeling equipments, but no one come to help2. After brought our luggages alone to receptionist, he told us to make another extra payment because we bring our children. They said that hotel's policy requires us to pay. When I said that I never experienced like this and my kids will sleep with me so no need for extra bed, the receptionist and the hotel manager said that we still have to pay because our kids (5 and 9 years old) will consume the hotel water... WHAT? Not trying to ruin our vacation, my wife calm me and we paid for extra charges3. Later I check at the hotel official website candibeachbali, the hotel policies mention that children under 12 are free, as long sleep with their PARENTS. I came back to receptionist and asked explanation about this. After waiting, a manager show up and mention that the hotel's policy already mention in Agoda. I asked why than it's different with hotel official website, she mention that they don't put all the policy there, and they only tolerate if I have one child. If I have two kids, they will charge for one kid.And I said, it's not there in the hotel's policy. Why different?And she said that because I bought from Agoda which is CHEAPER than their official website, so there was DIFFERENT hotel policy. I was very surprise by her answer because that was a very arrogant answer. I was felt look down by her and thought that she just made up that answer. I than replied so it is because different price, and she said yes. The manager seem angry and was trying to void my payment. I said no need to do that because of I can accept that answer. I felt like no use to talk to the hotel because they won't listen. It waste of time. Besides that, I felt like she want to intimidate me and I dont want them to do something nasty to me or my family. I said all I want is vacation here and don't ruin it.I don't want my money back, I just want explanation because I don't like being fooled.","December 31, 2018","23    Candi Beach Resort & Spa

We had the privilege to have a up-grade and stayed in luxury pool-villa this was really a five star experiece. Great breakfast for all and very nice, relaxing beach/pool area.

1343,"Room size is big and spacious, has Jacuzzi and big bath tub. View of the sea is great as well. Transport service from the Airport was unpleasant as the driver is hard-selling on taking his package tours. The vehicle is not clean and air ventilation was bad. The transport vehicle from the hotel back to the airport was much better. Massage provided in the package was good.Food for both restaurants at the resort is limited and not up to expectations.Reception staff gave the wrong orders for our romantic dinner menu and forgot my request for additional tissue box. Expected more quality services and food standards for price paid. Would have been a better experience if not for those mishaps.","October 7, 2018","23    Candi Beach Resort & Spa

The breakfast is huge with decent choices. The housekeeping did a good job, and also had a turn down service at nighttime which was a nice touch. There are 2 pools, and the ocean which is safe to swim in. We will definitely be back. ","October 3, 2018","23    Candi Beach Resort & Spa

1345,"We stayed as a family of 5 at Candi Beach Resort and Spa for 4 nights. We had booked 2 garden view rooms and although they were interconnected they were very small and not suitable for our family of 2 teenagers and younger child. Candi Beach upgraded us to a Villa at a very reasonable negotiated extra price. The villa was beautifully appointed, complete with our own pool. It was set idealically amongst the back drop of the mountains in a stunning landscaped garden setting. No ocean view but this is not needed as the landscaped setting is picturesque. Although the Villas are not designed to sleep 5 as they are essentially one large room with sleeping and living space combined and a separate luxuriously appointed bathroom, the hotel provided us with an additional bed and we were all comfortable. I would recommend the Villas for a couple or family with a young child as long as they are aware pools are not fenced. The resort has 2 pools and access to a private beach. We enjoyed breakfast each morning and the buffet dinner at the restaurant. The resort has some surrounding restaurants/ cafes and a spa where we had a very good massage. We found these restaurants far better than going into Candidasa which was disappointing with no beach views or access. Also it is interesting to go for a walk down the little laneways to see the village houses etc outside the resort , if you like to explore.","September 30, 2018","23    Candi Beach Resort & Spa

1346,Candidasa is a lovely small village and Candi resort and spa is surely a gem around 2kms from Candidasa. The place is on east side of Bali and not very touristy. We were looking for a place away from the hustle-bustle and party scenes of Bali and this totally lived upto the expectations. The beach is perfect - white sand and turquoise blue waters on one side and a hill and lots of palm trees on the other side. We had booked Ocean Bungalow which had beach view but not uninterrupted - it was pool view and then beach view (could have been better if they would have clearly mentioned that all ocean rooms do not have uninterrupted views; the description on website is bit confusing). The staff is amazing - very courteous and helpful which is usually the case in Bali (never had a bad experience with people anywhere!). The food at the restaurant is good too. Overall a peaceful luxurious stay and beautiful views all around.,"September 22, 2018","23    Candi Beach Resort & Spa

1347,"We stayed at Candi beach for 9 nights in early September, following a 4 night stay in Ubud. Rather then reviewing the local area, weather, all-up experience i'll focus specifically on the hotel in this forumn. I'll try to introduce a little bit of witt but i'm fairly jet-lagged atmo.Positives:Food: The restaurant food quality was really good, the breakfasts had a good choice selection, the ocean restaurant western menu was really well prepared, and the prices (and i know this is a cheeky subject) we actually thought were not awful. They were double the nearby warungs (for some choices, within some warungs) but in general were comparable with other hotels, and less then our previous in Ubud. The quality and service was excellent and the room service variety was also good. They didn't mind bringing a cheeky pancake and some potatoe wedges to the room after several Bintangs at 11:00pm (despite pancake not being on the menu), this saved our hangover the following day and it was very tasty. Drink: Alcohol is expensive in Bali, enough said, but i enjoy it greatly. I didn't like that the hotel mentioned a corkage charge for brining alcohol into the hotel (10% of what they charge) not crazy, but annoying. Especially when a large 66CL Bintang in Candi is 85k +21% Tax/SCharge, and in the local shop we bought a 66CL Bintang for 30k out-right. It's expensive at Candi for drink, as with any hotel but the cocktail range was good and they were really well made so we didn't mind. Happily blew through a few M on some strong long island ice teas knowing we could have a naughty pancake in the room later to sober up. Overall this is positive, drinks weren't massively expensive and good quality cocktails.Room: The Villa's were spectacular, really beautifully kept and thought out environments, really special, even for Bali which is naturally beautiful. However see my negative below on this (Re Room). Location: Good, quiet, lovely beach, peaceful and beautiful surroundings, good spread of local warungs and alternative options nearby too. Really good location, one of the best we saw in all of Bali.Onto the Negatives: (worth noting we've given 4 stars still so i don't want to make this sound too much like a downer, but i'll go into some smaller/minor things, that knocks candi, in our opinion, off being a 5 star):Room: Initial delux garden room was very small and photo's (obviously because they're professionally done) on the website make it look bigger then it is, it's small, sorry, it just is. Not saying it's advertised as grand, but it was under-whelming to walk into. The hotel was unable to upgrade us straight away as the other rooms were full (people with sense had booked them). We managed to upgrade to the best luxury private pool villa 1 day into our stay as it was the room they had most availability in, for the last 8 nights. Note there was no discount offered, despite me asking (as we were VIP+ members of Experian that offered free room upgrades (i know this is cheeky, but our other hotel gave us an upgrade for free, Candi was tough), and the ""freebies"" they gave us were actually less then originally offered to us via email, if we were to have upgraded before we came. The negative here isn't the above however, it's the delux garden room is cheap in price, but also cheap in experience (in our opinion). You definatley don't feel special as such (not like we did in the hotel we stayed in beforehand), we had to pay alot for our villa upgrade, and it was this that made the holiday... but it cost. Food: Great food, we got the 3 course indonesian night banquet, was a buffet with everything pulled together, dancing was good though. We also got ill after booking the romantic dinner on the mountain special experience, both of us were sick that night... we only had 2 glasses of wine so it was down to the food.... view was unbelievable though, and the service was 5*****. The actual quality of food as said above was very good so i don't want to push this down too much. The waiters were lovely! LOVELY!Inconsistency: some days they'd bring us pancakes to breakfast, sometimes they said they wouldn't, the coffee machine broke a couple of days so coffees took ages (25 minutes) to come. Sometimes the yokes on eggs were rock solid, sometimes hash-browns massively over-done.. Sometimes they served an egg with the indonesian egg dish, sometimes not. it was inconsistent (note we're not fussy eaters, if i'm honest we knocked out a few local warung mains and eat near anything) but we do like yokes you can dip something into! Shuttle: We got the shuttle into Candidasa, when they picked us up, only sent one shuttle for 9 people, we allowed the family to go in front instead of leaving them there, so we waited 15 minutes to get re-picked back up, we were treated by cattle by the locals, everyone wanted to sell us snorkeling, fishing, glasses, bags... list goes on, wasn't pleasent. Overall the positives out-weight the more minor improvement points, but it was definatley not 5 star for us. The service, VILLA quality and location/food was really good, but if you don't pick the right room you won't get the same experience. Plus the a la cart menu breakfast is only for villa guests (if you want it included) same with afternoon tea. Our fault for not reading that, but it's true. Tours are more expensive from hotel, including shuttle back to airport (we're talking 40%) to local providers.","September 9, 2018","23    Candi Beach Resort & Spa

1351,"Stayed here for 4 nights with my partner and it was the highlight of our visit to Bali. We stayed in a bungalow with an ocean view which was a delight to wake up to every morning. Our room was clean and well presented with a large, comfortable bed. Bathroom was modern with two washbasins and mirrors and a large walk in shower. The hotel staff couldn't do enough to make your stay as enjoyable as possible and provided an excellent service. The swimming pool was clean and looked out onto the sea. Lots of comfy and clean sunloungers to recline on to enjoy the view as well as day beds. The breakfast was exceptional. Great selection on the buffet as well as the option to choose one dish from the menu, including dishes like crepe suzette and eggs benedict. Complimentary afternoon tea was a real highlight. The hotel offers some promotions which change daily such as buy one get one free cocktails. The dishes for lunch and dinner were a mix of Balinese and western cuisine and were well presented and delicious. The one slight downside for me was the 21% tax and service charge which was added on to the end of the bill. Would rather the tax was included in the price on the menu. We had a fabulous stay here and I would definitely come back again.","August 21, 2018","23    Candi Beach Resort & Spa

1352,"We had reserved 2 rooms for our family of 4, and they gave us two adjoining rooms - both with updated decor, etc. They were on the small side, but nicely appointed and had big bathrooms and we were happy to have adjoining. Would recommend for families.We all enjoyed the food on site, it was pricier than street dining but everything was very tasty and less expensive than other resorts we stayed at during our trip.The spa was on the pricy side, but lovely and if you don't have your sheets washed each night they leave you a 50% coupon for being 'green'.There was a complimentary walk in the morning (9am I believe) which we took - we were the only people doing it and it was a nice little 40min walk around the neighbouring community. The guide pointed out plants and little things of interest - it was a nice way to start the day.We also took the shuttle in to town - they drop you around all the shops and pick you up 2 hours later. There isn't a lot to do in town so 2hrs was plenty of time. The lobby has 2 big ponds and they give out cups of food to feed the fish which my kids loved doing. The beach was a disappointment and it was insanely windy when we were there so we didn't go in the beach at all and even the pool was too cold! But we hit unusual weather. I wouldn't choose this resort for a lengthy visit if you wanted beach time, pools were fine but the beach isn't nice for swimming/playing.","August 12, 2018","23    Candi Beach Resort & Spa

1353,"I stayed here for 5 wonderful nights with my teen daughter as the start of our first trip to Bali, and we were delighted by what we experienced. The manager here does an incredible job of making sure that everything on the property is in order. Their breakfast each morning is a wonderful variety and everything is delicious. Both pools are absolutely sparkling clean all the time, and all the grounds are maintained beautifully. We stayed in both an original room and one of the new ocean view suites, and we were comfortable and happy in both. The ocean suite is stunning. If one of the ocean view suites is available for your stay, do book it because they are amazing. But don't pass up this property at all, because the standard rooms are also very charming and comfortable and still offer you the wonderful grounds and the amazing treatment by everyone at the hotel. After exploring Candidasa, I suspect this is the absolute best property to choose for a stay in this area. This hotel will certainly be my choice when I return, and I highly recommend it if you prefer a quality experience in every way.","August 7, 2018","23    Candi Beach Resort & Spa

The a-la-carte breakfast is especially to recommend. The service is extremely good across the complete hotel, everyone is very friendly and you are always greated with a smile. The dinner is also fine, there are though quite a few other good options just outside the hotel or in Candidasa, which is a 5 minute taxi ride away.The overall atmosphere is very relaxed, the guest structure is international.If you are looking for a relaxed & at the same time luxurious resort, this is the place to go.

1360,"I usually don't like to 'repeat holidays', but my partner and I had such a great time at De Moksha last time we were in Bali that we had to come back again! The reasons we returned are: great rooms, beautiful surroundings, everything you could want or need in the resort, and most importantly: the staff!The staff at De Moksha are so welcoming and friendly. You are welcomed by name, and any requests you have will be immediately seen to. We particularly loved the company of Agus - he is so knowledgable and is constantly looking out for the comfort and wellbeing of the guests. We greatly enjoyed his company, he had great suggestions for things to do (we did the yoga class, massages, meditation class and bike ride offered by De Moksha) and he organised them all for us. Thank you for making our trip so great Agus!The eco resort is surrounded by rice fields, and is an ideal place to stay to get away from the noise of the main town centres. It takes about 20mins/25mins to drive to central Canggu from the resort, which makes it ideally located if you value a solid sleep, as Canggu is LOUD at night!Things to know if you are considering De Moksha:- the on site restaurant is incredible, with a variety of food options available. The kitchen staff speak fluent english and are able to cater to any dietary requests you have. When I travel, I like to experience new things, but the onsite restaurant is so good that we kept going back!- there are plenty of activities that can be organised for you, both within and outside of the property. Just discuss with the staff what sort of things you might be interested in, and they can make great suggestions. - the resort has motorbikes for hire. However, unless you are already licensed/ experienced in driving a scooter, I wouldn't recommend hiring a bike in Bali, as the roads can be crazy. De Moksha has a driver onsite (Wayan) who is wonderful and VERY reasonably priced!- the road leading up to De Moksha is a little rough, however, there are currently works happening to fix the street. You cannot see the inside of De Moksha from the road, but once you walk in - paradise!- there are new rooms, a new dining area, and a new pool being built at the moment, due to open later this year (2019). We couldn't hear any construction noise coming from De Moksha though. There is some building happening next door (not de Moksha) that can occasionally be heard, but it's not enough to disturb you or interfere with the tranquility.- very comfortable beds, effective AC, soft bedlinen, and the water in the pools (private room and resort pools) are so well maintained that the water is crystal clear. - the complimentary body products offered in the room (body wash, shampoo, conditioner, hand wash, moisturiser) are to die for. I am a big fan of Aesop products, and they are definitely on par. The only thing I would change: have the products in the room nicely packaged and available for sale, I would have loved to have bought some for gifts.","July 10, 2019","24    De Moksha Boutique Resort

1370,"I was really looking forward to staying at De Moksha because the photos, description on the booking sites and website make it sound amazing. They would benefit from investing more in maintaining the basic hotel facilities and training its junior customer-facing staff than its current expansion to the land next door. I encountered a number of issues: - I was initially delighted by the pre-stay questionnaire one week before arriving which asked me about my profile and what activities I wanted to do ‘so they could meet customer expectations’ but clearly the front desk don’t know what info i had already shared at check-in. He was unaware that I’d already informed them through the survey that I wanted to do yoga (main reason for staying there) and was quite inexperienced in managing the situation.- 24 hours after arriving management sent another survey asking me to rate the stay so far where I mentioned the wifi and tv in my room wasn’t working and suggestions on how they could reword the description about their yoga classes to manage guest expectations but don’t think anyone read it. No one acknowledged the issues I highlighted.- The description on the website and in the booklet in the room say there’s twice daily yoga on site which is misleading as there’s no classes being run in the beautiful yoga shala.- There hasn’t been an executive centre on site for 3 years and the wifi was patchy most of the time including in my room. Fortunately I discovered the wifi the main office was excellent quite by accident but only at the end of my stay.- the beautifully designed pool area was in great need of maintenance. We couldn’t swim in the dirty pool because of a broken filter. The jet spa and outdoor shower next to the pool weren’t working either. I really had hoped to have a better stay but it was these little things that spoilt what could have been a truly amazing holiday at De Moksha. Whilst I was unlucky with a few things meeting expectations thank you to the more experienced staff Agus, Wayan and Wiwit for trying your best to make my stay great!

1372,"Pros: Most of the staff are genuinely wanting to see you have a nice and relaxing holiday. The bathroom amenities are nice, breakfast is delicious and plentiful and the menu is otherwise really good and well priced. The sheets on the bed are really soft and the pillows and mattress were great.Cons: The main swimming pool was out of order upon our arrival. After speaking to other guests I established that it had been that way for a couple of days. The filters and pumps weren't working which meant that the pool turned green. When I spoke to the hotel front desk staff about this, firstly she wasn't actually aware of the problem and secondly apologised politely, said it should be fixed the next afternoon, but did not offer any compensation. When she said we could instead swim in our private pool, I said we couldn't do this either as our private pool pump and filters also weren't working (we had no power at all in our room - which was then fixed). Once the pumps and filters were fixed on the main pool, you could see that it was still not safe to swim in so we didn't get to go in it at all (main selling point for this place is the pool!)NYE dinner was overpriced for what was provided. There was heaps of mosquitoes and the resort did not provide any insect repellants or incense / citronella coils to deter them (there is currently a Japanese Encephalitis outbreak in Bali and other resorts provide coils to burn & repellant spray!) Someone had clearly tried to light up the oil diffuser sticks in our room & the room isn't sealed! There are large gaps in the ceiling.","January 7, 2019","24    De Moksha Boutique Resort

1388,"Not to understate the chic modern Javanese eco-design combined with traditional Balinese features of the resort it is the experience of truly living among the locals and being accepted into their lives that made our stay at De Moksha so special. Owner Gunn Wibisono recognizes the unique position of his resort away from the commercialization and is going to great lengths to develop walking and cycling tours to highlight the culture of the traditional villages. By employing all his staff from these nearby villages he has established such trusting relationships with these families that they welcome him and his guests into their homes to proudly explain their traditions. Our guide Agus took us on a cycle tour through villages, across the rice fields, past a duck farm, temples to a secluded surf beach to stop for a refreshment at his auntie's Warung. Later in the day he took us to see the Tannah Lot temple at sunset and to watch him dance in a traditional Kecak Dance before an Ocean View dinner.

1393,"This resort was, at first glance, a beautiful escape from the chaos of Kuta. The eco-lodge concept is great in a region devastated by rubbish in parts. However, the experience at De Moksha was not as perfect as we had hoped.Firstly, the villas themselves were less private than we had expected. In other parts of Bali, the villas were completely private with high walls surrounding the villas. Here, the villas with their 'private pools' were completely open to anyone else staying there as there was no wall around the villa to retain privacy. This ultimately lead to us keeping our blinds closed as anyone walking past our villa could peer through the windows and see us. The second fault of the villas was the partially open air roof. This minimised the effectiveness of the air conditioning and also resulted in numerous bugs getting in the villa at night.The completely open bathroom was nice during the day, but was a little uncomfortable at night, especially as there were a number of spiders around outside at night.We thought the breakfast was very well prepared, but we were disappointed to see the street dog (which hangs around the resort, but which has mange and worms) was walking in and out of the kitchen/food storage area. We commented on this to staff who laughed and said, 'yes. She likes to sleep in there'. After that, we were really uninterested in continuing to eat at the restaurant.The yoga pavillion is located by the dining area and is a beautiful set up. However, classes are $25 for a single person to attend, which is incredibly expensive and unreasonable. I notably never noticed any classes taking place and I assume the price is probably the offputting factor here.The private pool was very small and was really only a dip pool beside our villa, but it wasn't clean (we could see green algae in it) and so we never decided to use it. We also noticed the main pool wasn't particularly clean and this was quite disappointing.Lastly, the villa is really far away from anything, so you have no option but to organise drivers, which is very costly. If the resort had a more appealing pool, restaurant and affordable activities, this might be less of an issue, but as these were all sorely lacking, we left the resort for other activities at a significant cost.Despite all my comments above, I do believe the resort has great potential if the above issues are addressed. The location is really peaceful and could be a very idyllic escape for couples.","April 22, 2018","24    De Moksha Boutique Resort

1401,"[TRIGGER WARNING: READ THIS ONLY IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW GOOD DOES IT FEEL TO STAY IN DE MOKSHA]Before we begin this lengthy praises of how beautiful De Moksha and how ethereal it can be as your accommodation while you stay in Bali, I would like to thank particular party who complete my vacation in Bali. Special regard goes to Ayu, the most amazing Hostess (P.S: She knows almost every part of Bali, you can ask her to guide you whenever you want to go. Out of her shift of course. Plus she can drive a motorcycle! Such an amazing person!). And then to the owner of the resort! They were there and they tried their hardest to listen to your input regarding the resort. So do not hesitate to talk to them! Mas Gunawan and Mas Hans are a couple of wonderful souls!Let’s begin this!Me and my friends stayed in two different type of the resorts; the two bedroom villa and the main villa. The two bedroom villa was spacious with a high ceiling and every bedroom equipped with a luxurious bathroom; a perfect place to indulge with yourself (or your partner). The bathroom has a bath tub which can be place to contemplate, tranquilize your mind, or as simple as enjoying wine throughout the night.Here comes my favorite about the bathroom: They provide shampoo, soap, and hair conditioner with natural fragrance! Unlike other toiletries in several places I have stayed, their toiletries do not ruin your hair or skin, they rejuvenate it! I came home with smoother skin and hair (This is not exaggerating)Once you finish your business in the bathroom, you can slide yourself into the bath robe. The bath robe is a five star itself, it has a really smooth fabrics and feel so comfortable on your skin. I literally felt like in a vacation while roaming through my villa or just sitting in front the television watching some tv show or program when I was not going out.The two bedroom villa provided a private pool where you can enjoy the sun and have a little pool party with your friends. The water was amazing, it does not hurt your eyes because the chlorine is not really strong (ergo, it wont ruin your skin as much as regular swimming pool water do)The bedroom itself has an exquisite bed sheeted with comfortable fabric. They told me that they use some special fabric which will adapt to the room temperature, by adapt I mean that the fabric will turn warm when the room temperature is cold, and it will turn cool when the room temperature is hot. On top of that, I enjoy the fluffiness of the pillow, really send you to the dream world.On the last days of our stay in Bali, we moved to the main villa which was located on the highest ground of the villa. The main villa is a studio room equipped with an open air bathroom (this seems like their signature⎻presenting the experience of interacting with the nature of Bali).There are not much difference between the studio room villa and the two bedroom villa, they provide the same comfort and the touch of Balinese culture in the room. There is only one difference I spot while I stayed there: There was a chakra light on the ceiling to complete your leisure. The owner told me that we can utilize the chakra light depend on the color of the light and one of them is to boost the sensual energy in the (red). This room is worth to try if you are taking a vacation only with your partner here.The rate for each rooms are breakfast included. You can walk down to “hill” of the villa and enjoy an open air breakfast (accompanied with the sound and the fresh air of nature). They serve variety of breakfasts, from the traditional Indonesian breakfast to a western style breakfast. I only tried the traditional Indonesian breakfast and hearty breakfast (typical breakfast with sausages, bacon, ham, eggs). They will serve the breakfast with the complement of fruits, variety of breads, tea, and a juice. Most of the time, Ayu the Hostess service us through our breakfast time and she is so entertaining. What I love about this villa is they are really inclusive and open about the real notion of diversity, you will complete your vacation with tons of new experience.People probably worried about the location of this villa which is quite far from the frenzy of Bali night life experience. I assure you, do not worry, they provide motorcycles and also a car for you to rent so you can travel from the villa to other places.For me, if you are looking for a place in Bali where you can experience the “real” Bali, you have to try this villa. They offer varieties of experience which will make your stay memorable. Along this review i attach the snippets for my stay in De Moksha.","October 27, 2017","24    De Moksha Boutique Resort

The spa is very reasonably priced and next to a small running river which makes for a lovely atmosphere. Pool is great and the staff are fantastic. Costs around £3 to get to Tanah Lot Temple.

1407,"I truly loved my time in the sanctuary that is De Moksha. As someone that has been to Bali and stayed in many Villas over 20 years this is an exceptional place. The villas are very luxuriously appointed with wonderful taste and execution. Privacy of the villas and private pools is achieved through lush gardens and a secret tropical garden design. With panoramic views over verdant rice Padi terraces you can only feel rejuvenated and refreshed. The staff are truely lovely and helpful. I had some travel requests for when I arrived and they were handled very smoothly and without issue. The staff from reception, to security, restaurant and housekeeping were al lovely. Very nice setting for meals beside the rice Padi terraces. Wonderful staff there and the food was very good quality and healthy.

The place is amazing.our room was in the second floor where we can experience amazing view from the balcony. First we would like to get the room with private pool... but who need private pool when the swimming pool seems like our ""private pool"" already as the hotel is not big and you can feel the ambiance of staying in semi private hotel. The room is equiped with homemade toiletries which are sooo amazing... they leave my skin smoother and my energy hair. The room is spacious and will give you a quality sleep and relax.The restaurant lays next to the rice field which give you amazing view during breakfast. The food is actually so so... but thank god to the view and lovely pregnant waitress (i forgot her name) which i'm sure has made the food tasted better This place is really suitable for you who wants to escape from the city... wants to spend quality time with the couple and family ... but probably no really suitable for the ones who love the husle and busle of the city.","August 14, 2017","24    De Moksha Boutique Resort

1421,"Halfway through a trip around Bali last week, another couple and ourselves wanted to appreciate the laid back nature and outdoor activities of Nusa Lembongan. The islands (including Nusa Ceningan and Nusa Penida) have a lot of fun outdoor things to do, but the development is much more basic and sparse. So it was amazing to find this 5 star experience to call home!The hotel is small but beautiful! Stepping up a hillside with just 12 rooms of various sizes every room has a view. We had the Pavana Premium Room which offered gorgeous morning views of the volcano on Bali. The room was extremely spacious and well appointed with luxury finishes that would stand up to comparison to high end hotels around the world. The stepping nature of the building allows for 2 different vanishing edge pools to relax in after a long hot day adventuring (a drink in hand in the pool looking out at the view under the large Tamarind tree is perfection!). The food and drinks at the poolside open air restaurant are creative and offer something for everyone from both west and east. We tried a lot of things on the menu and loved every one! And the all day breakfast was great! They offer essentially 2 breakfast entrees per person and since you can eat when ever, you can have one when you get up and the other later after a dip in the pool or a treatment at their spa (great too!).What really clinched how much we loved the hotel though was the caring staff and all that they did for us. The Balinese people as a whole seem kind and friendly but this was to another level! The front desk staff (including Indah) bent over backwards helping us set up all of our activities and directing us to the best restaurants (try Lemongrass and Warung Bambu). And the restaurant staff always had a story and a constant smile (tons of giggles too!). Mae and Intan went above and beyond though after my husband bruised his arm pretty good on a moped. For the entire time we were there they were checking on himand on their own bringing ice up to the room for his arm!All 4 of us wish that we could have stayed there longer! It was the highlight of our trip! Thank you Tamarind!","May 12, 2019","25    The Tamarind Resort Nusa Lembongan

We were so excited for our upcoming adventures on the island and a little break from the hustle and bustle of Bali. Neither of us had been to Nusa Lembongan, Cenigan or Penida before, so we had a lot of exploring to do. When we arrived at the hotel only a short walk from the harbour, we were greeted by the lovely staff who were beyond helpful. They provided multiple recommendations of where to explore, where to eat and what are the must sees on the island. The hotel itself has two beautiful swimming pools, overlooking the beautiful ocean and it's very well maintained.

Major downturn for us were the ceremonies held nearby, which start at 6am and continue throughout the day. They're quite noisy, so if you're here for some peace, it might be something to take into account.

Particular thanks to Chusnul who was very kind as well as Pinkan and Mita (Hope that’s correct) who served us everyday at breakfast and shared their stories with us about where they came from and life in Nusa Lembongan.

1428,"There are so many incredible things I can say about the Tamarind Resort. I actually made a TripAdvisor account so that I can leave a review for the hotel. The first thing i have to say is that this is quite possibly one of the best all around resorts I have ever had the pleasure of staying at, anywhere in the world. When you consider the price of rooms a night it also becomes the best valued stay I’ve ever had. It’s definitely more expensive than other hotels in the area but it’s not obscene and when you consider all of intangibles involved with the resort it instantly becomes worth it. The staff is a highlight of the resort. They were so accommodating, understanding and brilliant. They were extremely adaptable, knowledgeable and kind. I spoke to a couple of people on staff and I enjoyed their company immensely. The breakfasts which are part of the room fee were amazing. The multiple infinity pools after a day of adventure were cooling and rejuvenating and the gym was the best I’ve seen during my weeks in Indonesia. The staff hooked up multiple tours, a scooter rental, and multiple reservations. They truly go above and beyond with their service. It’s a feeling that reverberates throughout the island and it’s intoxicating. I’d suggest taking the tour to Nusa Pineda, it’s the bigger adjacent island which is more untouched and majestic filled with beautiful beaches and beautiful people. I know this sounds too good to be true already but the rooms are amazing. I got a deluxe room which was spacious clean and beautifully designed. The view from the balcony lit up gold and tangerine skies every evening and provided a good relaxing place to just chill out. The beds — maybe the most comfortable ones I have slept on in quite some time. I am going to need someone from the resort to tell me what brand they are. At the end of the day I’m toint to recommend the Tamarind to anyone looking to spend a little bit more for a trulyIncredible and comfortable experience on Nusa Lembongan. There is something that everyone from the management to the staff of the hotel is doing right and it’s a really cool feeling to witness something like that.","March 20, 2019","25    The Tamarind Resort Nusa Lembongan

There were stains on all of the furniture (couch, table, chair and pillow) as well as a big gross glob of hair in the shower before I used it! The rooms are big but there is the wrong type of furniture in them to make them feel luxurious as mentioned it is also dirty.There are some lovely touches here a cake in our room for our honeymoon, swim up bar, breakfast and a card delivered each night with suggestions for the next day. But the owner needs to spend some money modernizing and maintaining this property.

The breakfast served by Indica is superb and we even got to enjoy a floating breakfast on the pool one morning. Our room was really spacious and modern with great amenities supplied in the bathroom.

1431,"My parter and I stayed here for 2 nights. We booked through a third party website but once we had booked they contacted us directly to organise the boat from Sanur to Lembongan, they make it a easy and smooth trip over and they greet you as you hop off. The resort itself is stunning with great views and very nice and spacey rooms. The restaurant is good and the included breakfast is even better. They have a gym which is the best I have seen in a hotel in Bali which is great. If you want to book a scooter or buggy for they day they will deliver to reception and organise it all. (145k for scooter 800k for buggy)They make up your room twice a day and prep it for bed at night which is a nice touch. Overall the best stay I’ve had anywhere in Bali.

1432,"Of the several beautiful places we stayed in Bali, the Tamarind was by far our favorite. It was beautiful, clean, and comfortable with the most accomadating staff. They provided transportion around the island, picking us up from our ferry, bringing us to our activities, and even to and from dinner. They arranged all our activities for us which made fitting in everything we wanted to do a breeze. The service from everyone was impeccable, from the front desk, to the restaurant and bar, to housekeeping. Our favorite was Yoga at the restaurant. He made many suggestions and was always smiling. Breakfast was delicious, especially the homemade almond milk for our coffee. Drinks were tasty and room service was speedy. The room had anything you could need and the views were incredible. The private dinner up at the top pool was so romantic overlooking an incredible sunset. It was the perfect setting for our engagement :) I can’t say enough good things about this place. We hope to return some day soon. ","March 9, 2019","25    The Tamarind Resort Nusa Lembongan

We were disappointed in the food and drinks. Very western menu which is probably great when you are traveling with children, we weren't.

1436,"My family and I stayed in Tamarind's 3-bedroom villa in December 2018, and we have nothing but praises for the hotel. The one thing that amazed me the most was that even though the hotel was operating almost at full capacity, it didn't felt the place was overcrowded. The whole place just provides the sense of serenity, which is a much needed escape from the busy city life. Even though our villa didn't come with a private pool, the pool was literally 10 steps away from our door. There was even a swim-up bar to complete the whole experience. My husband and I had one of our best afternoon drinks there (as there was only 2 of us in the pool, and 1 bartender who provided us with her full attention). Checking in and out of the hotel was hassle free. The whole villa was very clean, and it provides one of the best views of the sea/beach in level 3 (while lazing on their day bed). Perhaps one of the downside was that there were no en-suite bathrooms to the 2 bedrooms in level 2. There was also a smell that came out from the bathroom in level 1 at night (perhaps the sewage?) but it was nothing too unbearable. The beds and pillows in Tamarind was also very comfortable and none of us had trouble falling asleep at night. We also requested to have breakfast delivered to our villa in the mornings. Breakfast was delivered on time, and every dish was amazing. Even though they missed out on 1 coffee on one of the mornings, it was delivered promptly. All in all, my family and I enjoyed the stay and I'll definitely stay in Tamarind again if I'm in Nusa Lembongan again.","February 16, 2019","25    The Tamarind Resort Nusa Lembongan

1437,"We stayed at the Tamarind for 4 days as part of our holiday in Bali, and I wish we could have stayed there for the entirety of our trip, it was simply "" heaven on earth"". The services they offer are above the 5 star rating! From the moment we landed we were treated to the Tamarinds outstanding service. We organised through the hotel to experience their "" VIP Service"". As soon as we stepped off the plane we were greeted by airport staff who promptly fast tracked us through immigration. There was no waiting in hour long queues. We were escorted to the lounge where refreshments awaited us while airport staff collected our baggage. Once collected we were seamlessly taken to our transport vehicle which was also organised by the Tamarind. For the small added fee, I can't recommend this service enough! Once we arrived at the hotel I was blown away. The intricate design which blends into its natural landscape combined with the high quality finishes really brings you into luxury. We were welcomed by friendly and very helpful staff who went above and beyond for all our needs. Nothing was to much trouble for them. We arrived to our rooms followed by our luggage, and the sense of luxury continued. The rooms are well thought out, minimalistic, extremely clean and very functional. Not to mention the best hotel beds and pillows I have ever had the pleasure of sleeping on!I thought it couldn't get any better, and then I was bought up to the main pool on the upper level. The views were absolutely breathtaking. The amazing infinity pool overlooks the island and sea and in clear skies allows you to see Mt Agung in all her glory. The service gets even better with the addition of the swim up bar which allows you to eat and drink without leaving the pool.The Spa at the Tamarind leaves nothing to be desired. It ranges from 2 hour bliss packages, to massages and facials. There really isn't anything the Tamarind doesn't have to meet your needs.The restaurant was beautiful and the included breakfast menu offered a great variety of meals. The kitchen is more than happy to tailor your meal to suit any deity requirements. I simply cannot praise The Tamarind high enough. From the minute you book your room to the minute you have to unfortunately part ways, you will experience the highest quality of service. You will not be disappointed. I'm eagerly awaiting my return to this heaven on earth. ","January 28, 2019","25    The Tamarind Resort Nusa Lembongan

Having stayed in many resort/hotels over many years the Tamarind outshines them all.The resort gently and serenely blends in and compliments the most spectacular natural space giving you a wonderful sense of peace and harmony as soon as you walk in.The staff are wonderful. They are always friendly, courteous and smiling, you genuinely feel like your at home here. We checked out all the facilities during our stay. The gym is state of the art and very well laid out.the three pools are just magic with the upper pool having the most awe inspiring view of the surrounds below. The spa is just heavenly i think i think i floated out.I was also lucky enough to participate in the cooking class with the chef. He was very generous in sharing the secrets of the Balinese cuisine.

I had a stomach issue when I arrived at the hotel (it started before I arrived at the Tamarind, nothing to do with the hotel) and the staff went way above and beyond to help me get better, offering us a variety of stomach-friendly teas, drinks & off-menu food that helped me get better in no time. They arranged all our activities, rentals & reservations on the island and truly made for a memorable stay.

1442,"Highly recommended for a simply luxurious, peaceful experience while exploring the area, we were always looking forward to being back in the comforts of The Tamarine after a day of activities! As frequent Bali visitors, but first timers to the Nusa Lembongan island, we were pleasantly surprised with the amazing hospitality and beautifully intimate setting of The Tamarine Resort. The area is still developing in comparison to Bali, but holds its own untouched charm.The location is great, super convenient to explore, but also away from the busier areas. A few minutes from the nearby ferry port, 8 mins buggy ride to Mushroom Bay bars and 12 mins to the popular Sandy Bay Beach Club. The island is basically only accessible by scooter or buggy, the Tamarine provides buggy rides at your request.The staff is top notch, starting with management to the friendly staff, super attentive and helpful. From addressing feedback of our room to providing personalized day trip tips to even finding first aid for injuries, they addressed every ask with a smile to make sure our stay was awesome. Thank you to Nigel, Pupusa, Pinkan for making our stay extra special!The only expectation to set is on the food which is mainly western, there’s a limited menu and was not what was expected for the price. We found the coffees, smashed avocado toast and the off-menu Nasi Goreng to be our go-tos.","January 5, 2019","25    The Tamarind Resort Nusa Lembongan

1445,"Stayed in a Villa for 4 nights with some girlfriends and absolutely loved the entire experience. From the greeting when we first arrived, to being shown around our villa and the the overall treatment by the staff. The pool is superb, the view is amazing and there is definitely a relaxing vibe around the pool. The swim up bar was ideal. The villa was way better that expected. It was massive, and offered very comfortable accomodation. The kitchen size was impressive, and the bedding was very comfortable. The bathrooms were excellent as well with plenty of room. The outdoor bath tub off the master bedroom on the lower level was a surprise, and an awesome touch. The turndown service at night with dessert was a little something extra. All the staff were extremely kind and helpful. I was too scared to scooter, so I was taken by buggy to certain locations on the island for free - this was really convenient for me because my friends were all on scooters. The food at the restaurant was excellent. The menu selection made you want to try everything - and nothing disappointed. We tried the gym and the facilities were better than expected - especially for an island resort. Sadly I only swam in the infinity pool on the top level, however loved the idea that there were 2 other pools to choose from - which would be convenient when I return with my family. I had a treatment at the day spa and really enjoyed the service - if I had more time I would have gone back. Overall, absolutely enjoyed my stay and wouldn't hesitate to recommend or rebook the Tamarind Resort.","December 10, 2018","25    The Tamarind Resort Nusa Lembongan

1447,"We had a wonderful stay at The Tamarind Resort in October.The resort is quite new and close to Jungutbatu and only about 500 metres from the Rocky Fast Cruises office.We received a lovely greeting from the reception staff, given a refreshing welcome drink then showed to our room on the third level of the resort.Our Pavana room had lovely views to Jungutbatu beach from the window and balcony.The room was spacious and very tastefully decorated. It beautifully cool and had every conceivable amenity and a nice bathroom with a rain shower. We did however expect a separate bathtub that wasn’t in our room.The standard of cleanliness was excellent and I liked the fact that they supplied drinking water in glass bottles with extra available complimentary on request. One of Bali’s biggest problems at the moment is plastic pollution and it is good to see the Tamarind is not contributing to this!We were close to the top infinity pool and we ended up spending a lot of time there!The views are to die for, we never had a problem getting a sun lounge and Freddy and the other staff were so obliging at the swim up pool bar. They even went down to the main restaurant to get me (good) coffee!The meals in the restaurant, Indica were excellent, fresh, tasty, nicely presented and reasonably priced.We especially enjoyed our breakfasts at the Tamarind. My wife loves breakfast in bed and it was a highlight of her Bali holiday to have a delicious a la carte breakfast delivered to the room.Usually I like to explore a new destination but we loved the Tamarind so much that we basically didn’t leave it for the first two days! I hired a scooter for the last to days to go have a look around Nusa Lembongan, this was arranged by the reception staff and it was delivered and picked up at the end.All the staff were wonderful so friendly and genuinely wanting to help.It was nice to meet the new resort manager, Armand.On departure we were given a special treat in the form of a traditional Balinese blessing at the shrine under the 300 year old Tamarind tree. I think it was Putu who did this for us and I found it very touching and one of the nicest things to happen to me in 11 trips to Bali.I thoroughly recommend the Tamarind Resort to anyone and would return in a heartbeat!","November 15, 2018","25    The Tamarind Resort Nusa Lembongan

Incredibly luxurious, with great rooms, excellent facilities and next level service.The staff at the resort were so friendly, always happy to help when needed. There's two infinity pools, one that's perfect for sunset and one perfect for sunrise. The dream. The room was huge, as was the bathroom, and I had a little balcony that was nice to relax on. The view from the balcony was impacted by large plants in front but it was still a nice atmosphere.The restaurant service did take a while and the food wasn't the best I've had, but it was still decent and they did apologise for the wait. The next morning I had the floating breakfast though which was one of the coolest experiences of my travels, and all that was DELICIOUS. The strawberries and cream in the breakfast was one of the best things I've ever eaten.Overall I was incredibly impressed by the Tamarind, I've already told all my friends and family about it and I can't wait to go back some time in the future.","October 19, 2018","25    The Tamarind Resort Nusa Lembongan

1460,"My husband and I stayed at The Tamarind in September 2018 for our honeymoon and really enjoyed our stay. For someone who has travelled to Nusa Lembongan twice already, I was interested to see what the newest hotel on the island was like. I was amazed to see such a 5-star hotel on the island! Situated an easy stroll to Nusa Lembongan village, The Tamarind is a relaxing escape for those wanting more pool action, than beach action. The rooftop pool (for in-house guests only) is serene and has an amazing view across the beach, village out the Mount Agung. I particularly loved the Hotel Spa – a beautiful oasis, offering amazing spa treatments. Not that we used the gym, but speaking to a local friend, the hotel gym is the best and most well stocked gym on the island. The rooms are well appointed – however, one small matter we couldn’t avoid was the slight smell from the bathroom drains. On arrival the room was stuffy and the smell from the drains was fairly strong. We needed to air out the bathroom for about a day before the smell dissipated. Understanding we were on an island and the sewerage system probably isn’t as good as a major city, we didn’t really mind and this didn’t affect our stay at all. The staff are so lovely and accommodating. They would ask us questions each day of what activities we were doing that day and offer suggestions. We did find the service of the tables/food a bit slow – but perhaps that is the island way?Overall, we had a comfortable and enjoyable stay at The Tamarind. We loved the rooftop pool, the pool bar, the hotel spa and the yummy daily breakfasts. Thank you Tamarind!","October 4, 2018","25    The Tamarind Resort Nusa Lembongan

1461,Overall we really enjoyed our stay at the Tamarind Resort. The Villa is just amazing and spacious. We really enjoyed the lounge area on the rooftop and loved that you could have your breakfast served up there. Unfortunately the warm water in the shower didn’t really work and the water smelled pretty bad. Also the bedroom kind of smelled when we turned of the air conditioning. I also didn’t like that they charged much more for all of the offered trips and to rent a scooter while using the same providers that you could book at the beach for much less. Nevertheless the view and the pool area were incredible! The included breakfast is also really good and you can order as much juice and coffee as you want. One thing I didn’t like is that the staff often just put the dirty dishes in front of the rooms and it was there for a few hours until somebody picked it up. The gym is very well equipped and clean! Overall we really enjoyed our stay and would book it again!,"October 1, 2018","25    The Tamarind Resort Nusa Lembongan

Squat rack, pull-up bar, cable machine, benches and an abundance of dumbbells (1kg- up to uber heavy) plus many other items. Room was nice n cool (2 aircon units, only one was on), had chilled water towels everything you would need. Cost is 10k per single session which can be seen as expensive in Bali terms but if you are looking for a clean safe gym to work off all the eating and drinking then this is the place!

The resort itself is beautiful, such a lovely tranquil setting and amazing views. The staff at the hotel were all so friendly and the service was excellent. We did see the manager a few times as well and had some good conversations with him which was a really nice touch.Our room was beautiful, very modern and the balcony views were just perfect. The room was cleaned to a high standard every day and we got a sweet treat every night when we came back in to the room which was lovely. The bed was one of the comfiest I have ever slept in...

We checked out some online and in person and then stumbled upon De Sapphire. The front desk was so friendly and had no problem showing us the rooms and accommodations to make us comfortable before booking. This was not only our favorite option in the area, but one of the more affordable as well! So many amazing restaurants and beaches within a 10 min scooter ride, which the reception was able to help us with. They were so accommodating, the rooms were unique and extremely clean. Little things from universal outlets, to letting us be picky with our food, made this place extra special.

1475,"What you’re paying for here is the beautiful clifftop location and sprawling view over the sea. The rest is not up to standard.Our villa’s downstairs toilet had not been properly cleaned and the stairs leading up to the bedroom smelled distinctly of urine. It was so overpowering and when we informed staff, all they did was spray chemicals on the stairs - the urine smell returned in minutes. We were also woken up by a very loud frog in our villa in the middle of the night, and then construction work/drilling right at our window in the morning!The shower pressure was also abysmal. The guest directory/book in the villa contained no information about the resort or services, only the restaurant’s menu. The restaurant drinks were really overpriced, with a small bottle of water being 20,000 IDR. The food was average, the breakfast bland.The wifi is basically non existent. I understand it’s Bali, but in various areas of the property, the speeds were between 0.5mb/s and 1 mb/s, according to our testing app.To rent scooters from the property it’s more expensive than normal, which makes no sense to charge already paying guests a premium. Transport to the airport is also 200,000 IRD more than regular price. Overall, it’s really overpriced (2,500,000 IRD+ for one night) for what you get. The location is gorgeous, but it’s just a rip off.","May 10, 2019","26    De Sapphire Cliff Villa

1480,"First of all I want to mention that our experience overall was good. Of course we had pros and cons.Pros:1) The view from villa is amazing. 2) The resort itself is placed in a good place not far from main road where you can find all the things that we find handy: cafes, pharmacies, motorbike rental places.3) The resort itself does provide motorbike rent service. However the price is higher than in local places.4) The staff is very kind.5) The Raj (gm) is doing his best in circumstances he’s now (we went trough several issues during our stay and all of them Raj has managed to solve).6) tasty food. The chef surprised us by unexpectedly tasty beef steak. Improvement points:1) reconstruction noise. I would make a limited schedule for noisy reconstruction work and make this schedule public so everyone can know when to expect noise. Maybe someone can adjust his day accordingly. I know that from management perspective this will prolong the redecoration process but maybe will make it more customers oriented. 2) reception stuff needs to be more trained in troubleshooting. They need to clearly understand where their responsibilities are ended and they have to call a manager in order to resolve customers’ issue.3) based on our experience I’d notify customers that they need to close the doors & windows during their absence since monkeys can come inside. 4) I’d place beach towels nearby the pool so i don’t need to run each time to the reception and ask for them.","January 2, 2019","26    De Sapphire Cliff Villa

It’s great fun especially on Sundays and Wednesdays lots of floors with bars and a DJ. Superb place to watch the sunset. Also close by Uluwatu Temple worth visiting for the comical dance show get there for 5pm. There is building work going on but it didn’t disturb us.

1485,"Checked into Da Sapphire hotel a few days ago . To start when we showed up the front of hotel was all boarded up . Looked as if it was closed . Reception was actually in a car park kiosk. Front desk staff we’re all very friendly and helpful . We hung out by the pool for a few hours while our room was getting cleaned . Pool towels looked stained and dirty like they had not been washed . Four vodka sodas came to 600k as well which was shocking . We we’re listening to hammering , sanding , and then to top it off they started jack hammering mid day . When we asked the GM Manager about it he said they were redoing the foundations for safety after the earthquake which we later found out was not the total truth . Several of the villas were under construction and getting built . After hours of construction noice we decided to leave for a bit . Upon arrival back jack hammering continued . At this point we decided that this was not what what we wanted to deal with and asked for our money to be returned so we could go to a more quiet peaceful place . Raj the GM spoke with us briefly then sent his front desk people to “deal with us “ They tried to move us to another room yet it was CLOSER to the construction. We just wanted to leave and be refunded . Raj finally Came to our room after an hour and proceeded to make excuses for everything still not accepting to return the money . He was EXTREMELY rude and unprofessional and I’ve never felt with anyone like him before . We decided to leave anyway without the refund and dispute it with booking.com . The easy part would have been to make us happy and not to argue a mute point . The room was actually really nice but worst management I’ve ever dealt with .

1486,"We had the most relaxing time at these villas.Great locations and views to die for overlooking the ocean. Spent every evening on a sunbed with a beer watching the sun go down. Gorgeous.Pool area was lovely, bar and restaurant were very good. We had pizza by the pool one day and a three course meal on another and both were very good. Staff were always very happy to come and bring drinks and food to you by the pool when you ordered but rarely came round to ask if you wanted anything which might be something for the hotel to consider when the restaurant is quite. On the outside a couple of the villas looked a little tired as well as reception and the sunbed cushions were discoloured but there was lots of work being done painting and fixing (did not disturb in any way) whilst we were there. I only mention it as when we first arrived I noticed, but in no way did it impact on how amazing everything was. We had an ocean view villa and it was gorgeous inside. Very clean, looked brand new and loads of technology inclusing two massive tvs. View from the balcony was lovely. Massages were available in your villa or overlooking the ocean and reasonably priced. Staff helped us with a restaurant reservation and hiring a scooter.A couple of minute walk to Ulu Cliffhouse which is worth a visit to lounge by the pool and have a drink and 15mins walk to Single Fin.

It’s a quaint hotel which was nice, didn’t feel like a big resort feel. I don’t normally write reviews but what prompted me to is the service we received from everyone at the front desk, but specifically Kutut. Kutut taught us how to ride a scooter since it was our first time, and was so patient and helpful. Then, later that night when we were going out for dinner, our taxi driver was late and he knew we had a reservation time to make, so Kutut drove up in his car and drove us himself. Very very nice people and beautiful views, close by to walk to Single Fin area and restaurants. Thanks for the nice stay. ","September 3, 2018","26    De Sapphire Cliff Villa

The pool area looking out over the cliff with the bar and restaurant right next to it with pool side service is perfect. It is only a short walk to the cliff face bars and restaurants, also where you can walk down to the beach.Would highly recommend staying here as I would stay again myself.","August 27, 2018","26    De Sapphire Cliff Villa

It's everything we could ask for in Bali in terms of enjoyable stay, especially after we had a less positive experience due to earthquakes happening in July-August in other parts of Bali. And the pool is very convenient if you'd like to take it easy at the complex during the day. One thing that could be improved though is the food menu and the quantities served.Would definitely recommend it!","August 12, 2018","26    De Sapphire Cliff Villa

1497,"Stayed for a week with my husband and two kids (a todler and a baby 9 months old). Great views and friendly staff, but a lot of small things became irritating during our stay. 1. MUSIC. We had to ask at almost every meal to have the music turned down in the restaurant because it was so loud we could barely speak to each other. And a suggestion: maybe wait until afternoon to turn the music on all together. It’s not necessary (or very relaxing) to have to listen to music from you wake up till you go to bed. 2. MUSIC pt 2. Please change the music more often. We stayed for 7 nights and it was the same 6-8 songs on repeat. 3. WATER. Do as the eco resorts: put a gallon of water in every room so we can refill our plastic bottles - and reduse plastic in Bali. On their website it says the hotel is eco-friendly but I’m not quite sure where that lies. 4. HOUSEKEEPING. Pay more attention to the ‘tidy my villa’-sign. When staying with to small children, it’s very inconvenient that the housekeeping hasn’t been done until just before bedtime even though the sign in question had been on the door several times during the day. But we did enjoy the pool which is great for kids. And the staff was very friendly as well. Over all it seems that a few but key things could male this place great!","July 28, 2018","26    De Sapphire Cliff Villa

The villa was huge with two floors and two bathrooms and a large balcony. There was plenty of wardrobe space and a safe. The location of the resort is brilliant, with views out over the ocean and a few minutes walk from many restaurants and bars (ulu cliffhouse and single fin both in walking distance). They had the World Cup playing on a projector whilst we were staying which bought a few people in and had a good atmosphere.Would definitely recommend this place!

We hired a bike and enjoyed riding the short distances to beautiful beaches, the temple, sunset at Single Fin etc. The restaurant on site has a beautiful setting. We had to provide coupons for breakfast and the breakfast menu was a bit limited. I found it odd that on just one occasion at breakfast I asked for milk with my tea and was refused.

The only down side is sometimes it was hard to leave. We were traveling with a little one under 2 and the staff were great with her.

The area is just so great, nearby restos and padang padang + blue point beach is just a walk away. The staff are just exemplary, so accomodating. We had a wonderful talk with their Managers Mr. Raj and Sandy! Everyone is just so awesome treats you like family. Had tried their breakfast provided as ala cart which is tote fine, the next day breakfast was given buffet already. Great but not much choices tho nevertheless everything was just delectable. We had taken dinner served with wine at their restaurant for our last night and its a best decision we made to relax as we were quite exhausted for the day. Overall, thumbs up! We will definitely consider staying here again in case we decide to revisit uluwatu. To the owner and management, your people are just exemplary! Good Job! Keep up the good work and all the best!

Also, floor boards up stairs on balcony were slightly wobbly and weak. The room was an interesting set up, as downstairs and upstairs had doors separating the two so you could not easily access downstairs internally (could not hear door when it is being knocked).I would also suggest some room diffusers to help minimise the old musty wood smell.The breakfast was good, perhaps more variety as it is set as a la carte but only about 5 options (not good if you are a fussy eater like me)Overall, it was a nice stay with a great view and friendly staff.","January 29, 2018","26    De Sapphire Cliff Villa

It's in a very quiet spot just a few mins walk off the main road, near to a yoga studio & has amazing sea views. The staff were so friendly & very helpful. However, our room (nr 27) was grubby & could really do with a really good clean. I know I'm being picky, but here's a run down ... a lot of rust & calcium deposit (from the water) around the shower area it just looked neglected, layers of dust on various areas, cobwebs by the tv, dirty marks on the mirror, dirty curtains around the bed (where housekeeping mop the floor & the dirty water seeps onto the bottom of the net curtains), sloppy/patchy paintwork on walls, splashes of wood varnish on the windows .. these should have been wiped off, paint spots on the floor which made the floor (poor workmanship if you can't be bothered to cover the floor when painting!) & water damage stains on the ceiling.

We didn’t want the room cleaned everyday but when we asked it was pointless. The breakfast options are poor at best and having to pay for a fruit platter or omelette seems insane in Bali. We where asked to “pre pay” for any thing we wanted to consume out of the mini bar or room service which also seemed out of the ordinary considering they had our credit cards on file. The hotel reception staff told us that there where no taxis available to the hotel and refused to call us one when we wanted to go to seminyak shopping and we had to use their extremely over priced service.

We found the staff very friendly and accommodating. Upon our arrival I thought our room was clean and it was cleaned daily. The bed was very comfortable and the design of the villas made you feel like you were in your own tropical paradise. I do need to mention a couple of things though..I didn’t like that the lounge was open to the elements. I’m a bit paranoid about getting bitten by mosquitos and other bugs so we often didn’t laze around at night in the lounge area. Now in terms of food...but bare in mind my husband and I are a bit fussy....we didn’t like the food and the cocktails weren’t great either. Further, the villas are a bit remote so it’s a shame there isn’t a complimentary car service to get you around. It was a bit annoying having to get cabs all the time when we have stayed at other places previously with this service included. However you can rent motor bikes (I think for free) but we didn’t feel comfortable doing that. There are some nice places to eat at outside of the hideaways so my suggestion would be to venture out. My husband and I got a day pass for one day and went to the Radisson Blu which is about 3kms down the road. The food and cocktails there are really good and it was nice for us to change up the scenery a bit. All in all we enjoyed our stay but we couldn’t rate it higher due to the food.","April 24, 2019","27    Hideaway Villas Bali

1530,"Located several hundred meters up a bumpy winding road it is aptly named Hideaway. The location is listed in Google Maps, so you can find your way here even if your driver has never been here. It’s near the New Kuta Golf Club and the Garuda Wisnu Kencana monument.From here, it can take about 1.5 hours in a car to get to Seminyak, due to traffic, but again this place is called The Hideaway and one wouldn’t stay here to be close to all the hustle and bustle.Fortunately all the food and services are reasonably priced (at least to my American tourist standards) and I didn’t really need to leave the place to eat or exercise or relax.There is no large communal pool, but every unit has its own private pool.The massages from the spa are very good and cost less than they do back home.Staff is professional and attentive, especially Surya and Ulan. Very friendly people. The gym is small and there is only an exercise bike, a treadmill, and a weight bench in there. They should replace the weight bench with a multi-station resistance machine, that’s my only suggestion for improvement of the place.I would stay here again.","April 19, 2019","27    Hideaway Villas Bali

1554,"We recently stayed at Hideaway Villas for 3 nights to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We initially booked a 'Pool Suite' but only stayed for 1 night as it was not what we anticipated. There was no area to sit outside and access to the pool was through the bedroom or bathroom window. The air conditioner leaked and dripped and there were loud, crowing roosters from 5am which meant a sleep in was not possible.We requested a room change and moved to a '1 Bedroom Pool Villa' which was much more our style. Nice pool, day beds to sit outside and read etc. The room was quite open but the door to the bathroom provided some privacy and protection from bugs etc. Bathroom was nice, clean and well kept. Although there was no view of the ocean from any of the rooms it was very green and lush which is always nice. Breakfast was a bit boring, we anticipated a larger range and the ability to go up for additional servings but it was all just off of the menu. My husband is gluten free and they were very accommodating of dietary requirements. Also, the dining area overlooked the car park which wasn't very appealing. We did order a floating breakfast for 1 morning, it was a nice idea in theory but not practical at all. Getting out and about by foot is half the experience in Bali but this was not an option whilst at Hideaway. This is our second time in Bali but we weren't confident enough in hiring scooter so figured taxis would suffice - this was not the case.It was an expensive experience, particularity of an evening. Most restaurants had a flat rate to travel to Hideaway after a certain time (200,000 or $20 AUD) which is ridiculous for Bali considering it was a 5-10 minute journey! We had to walk quite a distance in order to find a taxi, it did not feel safe.The car service offered via Hideaway was no better in price but we did get a transfer from the airport which was very helpful. This shouldn't really be advertised as being in Uluwatu as it's so remote and right on the edge of the town. It has no easy road access and you're required to go down a windy road which makes you feel like you're in the middle of nowhere. To be honest our time at Hideaway was quite boring, there was no vibe. We spent most of our days out at various beach clubs like Sundays and Single Fin - getting there was fine but getting home was the issue.Staff were helpful but do need further training, there was definitely a communication breakdown. We also had to pay an additional fee upon arrival which we are still confused about but to be honest didn't bother pushing the point because of the language barrier. It was okay if you want to be super secluded but we wouldn't stay there again.","November 19, 2018","27    Hideaway Villas Bali

1567,"We arrived at the Hideaway villas quite late having booked it last minute online, due to the hotel we should have been staying in not being up to scratch. We were immediately impressed by the security at the villas and when we pulled up at reception our first impressions were great. Everyone was warm and friendly and after checking in were taken to our 1 bedroom villa. The Villas themselves are a fantastic design, a large imposing door giving way to a flight of concrete stairs which lead up to an infinity style pool with the water running down the wall beside the stairs. The lounge/diner is open plan and opens out on to the deck around the pool with an internal door leading into a well air conditioned bedroom with plenty of storage space and a contemporary well decorated bathroom with large bath and shower. The part ocean view from the deck and pool is glorious but could have been improved if the view from the pool was uninterrupted, infintity pool style, rather than being the top of the next villa. The Food available on site was great although having been used to buffet style breakfasts, having to order what we wanted wasn't as enjoyable. The resort itself is fairly remote with about a mile walk to get back to the main road, this increases the feeling of isolation so if you're looking to get away from it all and relax, this is the place. Though if you're not, then you can always hire a scooter to get out and about or failing that a driver for the day.","November 4, 2018","27    Hideaway Villas Bali

Everything feels very tired - furniture needs updating, paintwork peeling etc. We even found a used plaster under one of the sunbeds which made us feel the rooms were not very clean.Food was not good - beef was so tough it was inedible and everything felt rather greasy so we went out for every meal inc breakfast each day.Very disappointing as the photos are not an accurate description of reality.","October 30, 2018","27    Hideaway Villas Bali

1569,"My partner and I recently spent two lovely evenings at the Hideaway Villas! True to its name, the hotel is tucked away at the bottom of a winding road away from the hustle and bustle of the town. The grounds were maintained beautifully, with stunning flowers and greenery. The staff were very attentive to our needs, and even helped us organize a day trip into Ubud along with dinner and a spa experience at the hotel all for $100USD. There were a few times the staff made mistakes or miscalculations (with fees, and dinner orders) but overall the service was great. We loved our villa (we tried the floating breakfast in our pool which was incredible) and the room and bathroom were not only chic, but also very well maintained. Our spa experience was also 10/10 - both my partner and I loved our 60 minute massage service. The only thing that could use some improvement would be their food (our room service was quite average) and since there are not a ton of options for dinning out in that area the food at the hotel should really be a little higher quality.Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend the experience to any couple looking for a romantic retreat hideaway!","October 12, 2018","27    Hideaway Villas Bali

We decided to have our reception dinner at this villa as all we need is a Nice, Hidden villa which close to our ceremony location.We all had a great family time in the villa! The food is nice, services are spectacular. Their staff ( especially the sales manager Glory ) are very helpful and friendly.

The friendly and extremely helpful staff are what make this hotel what it is. Nothing is too much trouble. Our special thanks for excellent service goes to Rosa, Satria, Ari & Papua. We hired drivers and enjoyed visits to Tegalalang rice terraces, tempaksiring water spring and Taman ayun temple. By Taxi we visited the lovely nearby Thomas beach and then enjoyed great pizza at Single fin, watching surfers and the sunset. We had good food at El kabron, although too late for the sunset view we did catch their live music. If using taxis request bluebirds, they charge by the meter so avoid any who quote a fixed charge.

1573,My wife and I stayed here for our honeymoon. The first room they gave us was one concrete wall away from a farm that had at least one dozen roosters roaming freely. All day we heard roosters and even dogs barking. Our room also had no hot water and after maintenance spent 45 minutes in our room the first night they still couldn’t get it to work. The manager moved us to a better villa the next day but that villa still didn’t have hot water until our last night (we spent 3 nights). The gym at this resort was terrible. It was the poorest excuse of a gym I’ve seen. There was two adjustable dumbbells that weren’t even matching. They need to invest in some proper equipment and weights. The only saving grace of this resort was the staff. Everyone was very friendly and the manager gave my wife and I a free massage as an apology for the hassle we had to deal with. I think that Hideaway Villas owner should invest some more money into this resort as it’s portrayed as a 4-5 star resort but is actually only a 3 star. The rooms could also be cleaned more thoroughly. There was grime and green mildew on shower heads and roof of bathrooms. Also green mildew growing around edges of infinity pool. There is great potential for Hideaway Villas if some changes are made. ,"September 16, 2018","27    Hideaway Villas Bali

Staff very unobtrusive, you need to wave them across when you wish to be served, etc.We stayed in a bungalow (No.12), room was lovely with beautiful dark wood decor and high ceilings. But only downside is the presence of the farm next door, roosters/chickens and geese making a lot of noise from 3am, you will benefit from ear plugs to get a good night’s sleep! Recommend requesting rooms to the north / closer to the beach. We mentioned this to reception and hotel management were very sympathetic to us, and we were happy with their proposed solution.All in all a brilliant couple of days staying here - the food was excellent too albeit slightly more expensive than surroundings, but is of improved quality.","July 10, 2019","28    Indiana Kenanga Luxury Boutique Villas

1584,"We stayed in this hotel during our 4 day trip to nusa Lembongan.The room or rather villa/bungalow is very spacious, clean and the interiour gives it a real luxurious feeling. Bed, shower, toilet, anemities were all good. What we were missing roomwise though was a klamboe/mosquito net? Lembongan compared to Bali has more mosquitos and insects. Throughout our stay we were good food for the mosquitos and it would be nice if the beds had mosquito nets. Noisewise, we could hear scooters and animals, but Lembongang is pretty crowded, buildings and streets are built very close to each other, so I think you will have this issue on lots of places. Also, the hotel can't do anything about the dozen roosters in the neighboorhoud that like to compete on who can be the loudest! haha. While we were staying here we had a couple of friends and family also on Lembongan spread throughout the island and when we showed pictures they all said that it was very luxurious compared to their stay. Of course, I also believe this is one of the more expensive stays on the island.Staff friendliness was good, although the reception is not always staffed. Sometimes when we called, nobody was there to pick up the phone and we would have to walk to the reception. Also, the hotel could be more clear about the included breakfast. They said it was included, but during breaktfast we just got an a la carte menu and it wasn't really clear to us what was included or not. Could we order the whole menu? Did we have to choose a specific package like English or American? We had breakfast at the restaurant of another resort one of the mornings and we saw that they had a menu for their hotel guests which stated specifically what was included in their breakfast. Maybe that's something Indiana Kenanga could also do. The location was very nice. It was right on the beach and there were some nice places to eat within walking distance. All in all, it's definitely a great place to stay on the island.","October 3, 2018","28    Indiana Kenanga Luxury Boutique Villas

1585,"We stayed here for 2 nights, after staying for 3 nights in other place that was far better (and 3 times cheaper) than this hotel. We were so disappointed that having paid so much this was actually the worst stay during our 3 week trip.Actually just when we arrived in the reception there was another guest complaining about their family stay and saying so many things were broken, so seems to be pretty common.But let me start with few good things about Indiana>+ Location is very nice, next to the beautiful beach and many restaurants around+ You can rent a motorbike in hotel, no need to search far for it. + We liked the pool area , enough sunbeds as hotel is never crowded+ We struggled with shower in some of the hotels, but here it ran very good with enough hot water , not so easy on the islandAnd thats;about it- Rooms are tired and gloomy, you actually don;t want to stay inside the room at all- Lack of management, staff doesnt seem to care and know how to deal with issues- But the worse is that you can forget about a good night rest! And I am not talking about roosters and dogs barking, this is kind of part of the island life that you get used to, I am talking about the Diving center right next on the street. There are a group of Spanish working there, and they kept on screaming entire evening, with loud music, many people / we understood they are celebrating something, it actually felt like they are inside of our room! eventually my husband had to go ask them to keep quiet (which they did for approximately 5 minutes and then all over again). Reception is closed at 7 PM so there is no one to attend and help out here, it's kind of up to you to argue with these people. Seriously if you are running 2 businesses so close to each other you have to learn to cooperate, and from what we understood in the reception, the only one who spoke to them once or twice is the security guy. And yes, we complained in the morning and were not offered anything in return, not even a complimentary breakfast (which by the way was not included for this high price we paid), it seems to be a common complaint so they just say sorry and thats it.I cannot say anything about the food because there was no breakfast included for this price, but there are many options around.Overall the relation with quality you get for this price is awful.

Whilst the hotel is on a gorgeous beach with two great swimming pools, it does not meet expectations for the price paid in Bali. The staff are lovely but lack in any kind of initiative and service is poor. Getting an order taken for drinks or breakfast takes far longer than it should - the staff just stand talking to each other. We were woken up by construction work at 1am which was frustrating for us as we were up at 6am every day for diving. After complaining to the manager we were offered a complimentary dinner and for a lunch bill to be removed from our tab. We gladly accepted, however upon check out the manager changed her mind and said just a free dinner and refused to cancel the lunch bill. We felt uncomfortable arguing in front of the Indonesian staff as the discount for the food bill is a lot by Indonesian standards. Both the lunch and the dinner at the restaurant did not live up to expectations in terms of quality and the price paid. We got better food outside of the hotel for £20 whereas dinner for two comes in at £100 at the hotel. Overpriced hotel. Not 5 star service.

We still look back on our trip and remember this sour memory which I don't want anyone else to risk tainting their vacation. It started with us feeling mislead about the room we had booked when checking in, but talked it out with the European manager who agreed the booking site was wrong with the number of beds promised. He said we could contact the booking site directly, but in the meantime we had to pay more for the extra bed that we thought was included in our original price. (*The site has since been updated, but nothing was reversed for us) To make up for it, he said we would all receive complimentary breakfast. The first morning at breakfast we were told which portion of the menu was complimentary and enjoyed our meal. Second morning, after our meal, a check was brought to us to sign and since we didn't have to do this the first day we asked at the front desk where the person confirmed our meal with complimentary and signing was a formality. Our last morning, the waiter tells us that our meal is not complimentary and the manager comes out saying we need to pay for breakfast and back pay for the other mornings. It came out of nowhere for us and we were completely taken aback with the rude nature and aggressiveness of the European manager. We ended up packing up our things and checking out in near tears as we had never been treated this way before. They did not own up to their miscommunication issues and blamed it on us. It was not the level of hospitality or service you would expect in any situation. It really was a shame because we thought the food was great, local staff wonderful, and loved the property, but it was not worth being treated the way we were or the price we ended up paying.","June 1, 2017","28    Indiana Kenanga Luxury Boutique Villas

1601,"We had a good time, thanks to the staff as they were very welcoming and friendly.BUTFor more than 100$ a night you get:Rooms which are not clean and lack a lot of maintenance. Clogged drainage, the shower not working properly, you put your stuff somewhere and it's dirty afterwards, paint is coming off the walls, chairs in the garden broken, the door to the room not opening and closing properly. The pool doesn't really invite to stay longer and the French chef appears like an arrogant ***.Thanks again to the staff which made us enjoying our time.But if we would come again? NO - not for this price...Even the drinking water is charged for, where in modern times it's complimentary in most hotels esp in Asia. At least they should have a water dispenser for free use to avoid plastic but...It seems the owner just tries to make as much money as possible, is relying on his restaurant which is really good but has forgotten that people want to feel comfortable staying in his place.Conclusion: You can find better places for less money on the island.","April 28, 2017","28    Indiana Kenanga Luxury Boutique Villas

1602,"We stayed at this Hotel because our original booking at Tigerlillys was cancelled due to renovations. We were booking into Indiana by Tigerlillys so it was not our choice of hotel. It was very nice and the staff were friendly but it would not have been my choice of hotel. I did not like the privacy of the villa style accommodation as I was on my own most days while my husband was away diving. The pool was very quiet and was occupied most days by a couple of free divers practicing. The food was good, it was very clean and I would have no complaints at all other than it was not the hotel of my choosing. I also booked Tigerlillys as it had a no children policy and we had a crying baby near our room most of our stay. Hopefully we will get to stay at our chosen hotel next year.

1603,We felt there was a lack of soul in this hotel. It is not well managed and the people working there seem bored. The clientele is discreet and mostly made of couples. There was a mic mac with our reservation and we were upgraded to the double room villa which was great though too big for two. We enjoyed its private pool a lot and would come back. The French chef is very nice but cares more about surfing than cooking : it was an ok experience but not so great and expensive as he has a great experience with stared chefs in France and as it is the only French restaurant on the island. Better to eat balinese food in a small restaurant. Don't forget to rent a scooter if you want to discover some of the damaged beauties of the island. ,"March 6, 2017","28    Indiana Kenanga Luxury Boutique Villas

The Villa's presentation was first class, private and with your own pool and only 50m from the beach. The only negative was that due to the Villas being open and the both bedrooms being separate we didn't feel comfortable for our 3 kids to sleep by themselves in bedroom (This is only a very small negative) and the breakfast supplied was basic but all you need.

1612,"Arrival:Upon arrival we found the villa and decor to be simply stunning and very Asian posh with Buddha statues stylishly placed and whitewashed wooden furniture accenting the modern fusion feel of the place. Villa: Our villa is large with two bedrooms and a large swimming pool. A small kitchen area with a stovetop is excellent if you want to make a few things in the room. Cleanliness: it's surface clean but not deep clean. The tabletops are glass and very streaky. The pool/ beach towels smell of mildew. The room is lovely though and it's not like it's disgustingly dirty; It's just that it's also not exquisitely clean. This one is reflective of our standards. For us it's just a bit dingy overall, The bathrooms especially and the kitchen unit in the villa. Beach view from restaurant :  The restaurant area at the beach is simply stunning and the turquoise water captivates you. You can eat breakfast, dinner and lunch there and watch the surfers in the distance. Definitely a highlight.  Food: Lunch so far is fantastic, both at the French creperie restaurant and the beach restaurant. The clubhouse sandwich is superb. The crepes are interesting and delicious.  Breakfast however is a massive disappointment-- the selections "" included with the room"" are for either eggs or pancakes ... Coffee.... And juice. The bread is dry and they didn't get the eggs right on any day and didn't remember the complaints we had had to change things up and get it right the next. Also lattes and Cappuccino will cost you. The breakfast seriously is the worst part of our stay. This is not reflective of any French cuisine. Dinner:Apparently the French chef they have was away our week. Too bad for us. The dinner is quite delicious really but it is expensive. 15-+$30 entrees. We were able to order off the lunch menu to change it up but they ran out of ketchup. Perhaps a French restaurant doesn't have ketchup anyways but always nice to have on lunch French fries. Perhaps a staple item for one is not a staple for another. But it's ketchup!!Room issues : Hot water: ran out of propane so had no hot water for a day until we complained and the checked it. Toilets don't flush well-- had to call a plumber to plunge and fix. Service:It's ok. The people are pleasant and smile. Unfortunately they don't remember things well. We have a toddler who needs a paper cup so she's doesn't break the glass ones. Each day they brought us the same tall glass of juice and each day we had to ask again for a paper one. Very little English -- probably part of the miscommunication m, but it is Indonesia after all- can't fault them for that. Spa: It's gorgeous esthetically.Only had a pedicure. It was about 45 usd ( expensive) and wasn't very good. Didn't shave heels or anything. Very little cuticle work and it just was the most basic pedicure possible. Overall:It's still a gorgeous place on an island so it's never that bad is it? It's just overpriced and tries to sell you a level of accommodation and service that they simply don't provide. Again...: the people are very nice and that's always a positive point. ","April 26, 2016","28    Indiana Kenanga Luxury Boutique Villas

1621,"Indiana Kenanga has bags of potential to be a seriously great hotel but it fell short of the mark in several areas. This one of the pricier hotels on Lembongan but for a boutique, reasonable enough. However, compared to other boutiques in Bali and Asia, we were not overly impressed.The lay out it fantastic, the bungalows of good size but the interior decor is super dated, badly lit & a bit tacky. None of our lamps had bulbs in. The pool area is lovely & the front of the restaurant has a great spot to watch the sun go down with a cold bintang.The food however was disappointing & overpriced. Breakfast in particular was not good. Choice of poached eggs or the plainest omelette known to man. The coffee was undrinkable, eggs were either totally overdone or raw, underdone toast, fruit literally thrown on a plate & a serious lack of customer service. Not one member of staff greeted us warmly in the morning which is unheard of in this part of the world.We also had a minor issue with our safe. We were unable to get in to it & needed a master key. This happened in the evening, around 9pm. When we went to the front desk, the staff had locked up for the night & we just had the security guard to help. For a boutique hotel & at the price we paid, we expected at least one member of staff to be available. This was not a serious incident but it is a concern should something happen that requires a more senior member of staff!","September 24, 2015","28    Indiana Kenanga Luxury Boutique Villas

We loved our villa.The staff are friendly and helpful. We took advantage of our free cocktail and free massage for each of us.The restaurants have very good food, but are about double the price of any other hotel restaurant along the beach. It's definitely worth going to the Creperie - fabulous savoury and sweet crepes, but the main restaurant has nothing vegetarian at dinner, so we got pasta, pizza, indonesian or mexican food at other places.Our only real complaint of this place is the NOISE of the chickens and roosters. They don't just crow a few minutes at sunrise, but about once an hour throughout the night, and longer during the day. The locals houses are intermingled with the hotels, and so the sounds of roosters are everywhere. Bring earplugs!","August 23, 2015","28    Indiana Kenanga Luxury Boutique Villas

Initially had a few nights in a villa in Canggu then moved to Hotel Komune Resort. Wonderful reception after an hour's taxi drive from Canggu through Denpasar.We had two of the top deck rooms overlooking the sea and our own plunge pool which ran the length of the 20 odd rooms but had rope barriers between each unit to avoid lap swimmers disturbing other guests. The resort had two other pools, one a 25 metre lap pool in a ""quiet"" area where children were not permitted. This back area of the resort featured all the ""healthy"" activities such as yoga, meditation and gyms including an outdoor ""muscle"" training area. It also had an outdoor restaurant/bar for a delightful breakfast/lunch or dinner after your workout. Down on the beach was another pool more specifically for the families with kids. Beach swimming was not really an option as it is a surf beach only for pros plus there are many rocky inshore reefs and rips along shoreline. It is also a volcanic area so the sand is black. Not a big issue given the pool. The resort also has a large open air restaurant on the foreshore and the food is fabulous. Huge range of menu items catering for all types from vegans, veggies and carnivores. Presentation and quality is first rate and leaves a lot of Aussie restaurants to shame. All the resort staff are super friendly and efficient. In the evening they also put on a small open air theatre for the kids showing movies that keep them amused and out of their parents' hair for a while!Clientele is mostly Australian and I understand the resort is owned and operated by Australians. Plus the clientele is not your traditional ""Kuta Aussie"". Everybody was very friendly and no bad behavior anywhere.The rooms are delightful with your bed overlooking the sea and you fall asleep hearing the crashing of the waves. The rooms have all mod cons including full range of TV stations, fridge, mini bar, kettle, international power outlets, safe and cupboard space, ironing board etc. Take a few moments to study the operation of the shower as it is a little complicated and usually starts with a burst of cold water in your face from the handheld device! Pricing of food is very economical and you can feed four people for a quality dinner for about $80-$100 including drinks. If you have a late night flight home you can check out at 11.00am but put your luggage in a secure lock-up and stay around the resort using the facilities and then get changed late afternoon in the resort change rooms close to the gym area and then grab your taxi to the airport. (Allow about 90 mins to be safe) Food and drinks after check out can simply be paid on your credit car or cash as required. The resort also has a pavilion overlooking the beach for functions and weddings. In summary a marvellous resort with a focus on health activities.","June 30, 2019","29    Komune Resort, Keramas Beach Bali

1634,We live in Bali. Sometimes we feel the need to go week away from the Blayu village where we live. This Komune beach resort is our choice this time. Traveling with 2 children aged 9 and 10 years I was very surprised and happy when we were told that inside of the Resort there is a Kids club which is equipped with a skate board and cycling. We are not a surfer family where the Komune beach resort is famous for surfers even though all families with children are welcome here. The staff greeting us warmly. All Friendly. The view from our room 232 was very charming. Our first lunch today is also satisfying. Looking forward to trying out the Spa tomorrow. There are also several Gym Classes in the morning that I want to follow. Thank you to the GM for your hospitality welcoming us warmly. X,"June 29, 2019","29    Komune Resort, Keramas Beach Bali

The food is plentiful, delicious and caters for so many types of tastes. Great Rendang tacos! Beautiful cocktails and great plant based dishes when you are feeling healthy. So relaxing. If you can afford the option staying in a beachfront suite is pure heaven. Thank you so much for such a well needed, totally indulgent and chilled holiday!

If you needed anything for your room you just needed to ask and they would be there promptly. The rooms and resort was immaculate. Facilities were 5 star and the food was absolutely amazing. What surprised me was that food and drinks for a 5 star resort were reasonable. Wayne and his staff made sure we had everything we needed and don’t get me started on the day spa “bliss”.

Would suggest you ask before booking a front room. If you ring for an ice bucket don't expect it to arrive ,even after a 2nd request. The location is isolated but did enjoy this , the restaurants onsite do have fresh, tasty food. Overall enjoyed but perhaps room service staff need a little refresher especially as it was quicker for us to collect the things we asked for .","June 5, 2019","29    Komune Resort, Keramas Beach Bali

1642,"This resort is well run and I loved my Fitcation vacation here. The pricing is good for Aussies and they offer plenty of activities; starting with watching the pro surfing show, moving through massage & finishing at zen yoga - what's not to like?The rooms are fine for twin share, with the compact living, lack of privacy and storage being the biggest issue. We loved the gym, Muscle Beach, the two swimming pool areas. Well, I enjoyed the more lively party pool in small doses, but that is what is brilliant about the Komune, it is well thought through and there is something for everyone here.As food was an important component of our Fitcation, they nailed it completely. Loved the fresh food, juices and healthy eating options.WIfi seemed a bit of an issue but it was the Bali provider, not their internal resort connections. The local bar shack overlooking the paddy fields outside the gate, where the WIFI was perfect, which made a great office.I enjoyed using the Spa on several occasions, apart from one massage which I stopped after the pressure was too strong and I didn't like the sound of my back cracking. If that is you, say you 'no cracking!' I would love to return to this lovely resort at some point in the future. I left feeling fitter, stronger, healthier and happier.

1643,"Our experience at Komune was seamless right from the reservation stage. I don’t even know where to start but after a long awaited holiday due to being so caught up in the grind, it was the perfect way to unwind. We arrived on a Monday night and arrived at the hotel at around 10pm. We wondered around and honestly komune has everything! You do not need to leave - there’s a brilliant gym with all the facilities you could possibly image, beach club, yoga, one of the best spa locations and the list could go on. Our room was divine and after staying at some beautiful resorts both nationally and internationally I can say that it was up there as one of the best!

1646,"I stayed at the Komune for an 8 day yoga retreat and was blown away by this resort and it’s amenities. The grounds are beautifully kept, there are plenty of food options (also plenty gluten free, dairy free, vegan etc.). Both food and drinks were always presented beautifully and were always flavourful. The staff truly go above and beyond for their guests and will accommodate any of your needs. The spa is wonderful and offers very affordable packages (Try the goddess package or the hair cream treatment!). The health hub was great and offered beautiful yoga shalas and a pool to relax in as well as a fully decked out gym. The pool here is quieter and a great place to relax. The main pool area is fun and lively with music, drinks, and ice cream or fresh coconuts available. The pool itself overlooks the beach which is great for watching the surfers! The beach is a surfer lovers dream by far - waves were quite large during my time there. Unfortunately, this makes it difficult to swim at the beach. It’s also quite littered with garage which is unfortunate...The rooms were modern, clean, and simple (I stayed in a standard room). AC worked very well! The hot water in the shower will tend to run out later in the evening. It’s also easy to hear your neighbours as the rooms are not sound proofed. Overall, this is a wonderful resort and made my first stay in Bali a great one! Would definitely return :)","April 27, 2019","29    Komune Resort, Keramas Beach Bali

A wonderful place to forget about work and life demands. The offers a 5-foot deep pool that offers full view of the sea. The food is little mediocre and slightly overpriced. The bathroom facilities are clean but the cleaning schedule should be increased due to the sand and water accumulation caused by visitor usage. Overall, this is good family-oriented place to visit.

There was bad music, speeches and screaming from 6pm - 2am (the music died down around 12:30 - 1, but the screaming continued), and it genuinely was as though we were guests at the wedding. We actually tried to leave, but transport is hard to get because of the location. The hotel should have informed us of this prior to our check-in. Apparently, there are weddings or events every weekend so I would be sure to check this before booking. We went for a relaxing weekend getaway and this was anything but. The two nights cost around $900 Aud and I honestly wouldn't go again if i was paid double that. There are five star, luxury resorts close by where you can essentially have your own isolated, beachfront villa for this price.

1659,"The resort is lovely. The basic rooms are a ways from the beach shrouded in jungle but acceptable. The service is amazing and the spa superb...the issue is the smoke. 7 nights of toxic levels of smoke. Every time we asked the staff about the smoke they denied knowing what we were talking about. It was a bit like stepping into the Stepford Wives world. Finally after escalating we received a lame excuse that it was due to burning rice patties nearby. Given that every nearby rice paddy was in mid-growing cycle it was definitely Not burning rice fields causing the caustic smoke. Walking along the beach we found huge burning trash piles that are lit every night. In the jungle rooms, with the thick humidity the smoke is trapped all night and the smoke is stifling. While the scenery is divine, if you have any respiratory sensitivity, beware that the air quality is absolutely awful. We were also surprised by a “fogging notice” for bugs. Again a toxic surprise.

1661,"Let me say first, I hated the location and I left after 1 night. But I have several issues:Location: This resort is off a highway. There are 2 lanes going 1 direction on each side. Once you turn down the road to the resort it is very dark. If you wanted to walk out of the resort to a town…. There isn’t one. It is like walking out of an industrial area. You are stuck in this “resort”. I did not come to Bali for that experience. Maybe you want to check into a Yoga retreat and stay there all week. This is your place. We had to go to the hospital in Denpasar and it took 1 hour with traffic at 8 pm and the cost was $21 USD.Ask what is important to you before you book . On-line the website did not seem so remote. I did not come to Bali to be stuck in a remote location. We did not have our own car.Dining: Breakfast is NOT included which is common in Bali. There is only 2 restaurants 1 serves only Healthy food which means no cocktails, the other is on the beach and expensive. Breakfast is costly and adds up. Our Lunch was $150 US for 6 and when I asked for water the waitress told me it was self-serve that I could get it myself. I had to let her know we were having lunch as a group and it would be best if she could bring us water. That was crazy! The waitress told us to get our own water during my meal with 5 friends? This is an expensive Bali restaurant!Room: The standard rooms are far from the beach and even the beach rooms are separated from the beach by the pool, bar, and a wide undeveloped area. These rooms are much more expensive so make sure you understand what you are getting. You are not walking out of your Hawaii condo onto the sand. No!The Bedding: I don’t know if something went wrong but…. Our bed comfort was OK, but we hand only a bottom sheet. That is it. No top sheet and no blanket. There was a down comforter with a duvet. So here is my issues: Do they wash the entire Duvet each time – don’t know? But no thin top sheet so hope so.  No top sheet so ZERO covers if you don’t want a heavy down filled duvet. Bali doesn’t need a down Duvet. It is warm so a sheet and light blanket should be appropriate. Maybe they think they are saving water by not having a top sheet. I disagree.The bottom sheet on the bed was just a regular flat sheet. So it came untucked when I moved during the night and bunch up. The room is modern and fine. I will never go back … but again if you are looking to fly all the way to Bali to stay in 1 resort and do Yoga, then maybe this works.","February 13, 2019","29    Komune Resort, Keramas Beach Bali

You are treated as a VIP from the moment you make your reservation. Just before arriving I received an email from the resort director Andrea. She sent a wonderful email with an array of information that I wouldn’t have thought to ask about and relieved what anxiety I did have about visiting a foreign country. Once I arrived and met Andrea she welcomed us as if she was a long lost friend. All of the staff went out of their way to ensure my stay was nothing short of amazing! The food was delicious, the yoga energizing, the pools and beaches refreshing, the atmosphere gorgeous and the excursions unforgettable! I also met with the resort trainer Mark to attempt to not turn to a slug during vacation. Not only is Mark easy on the eyes but he knows his stuff! His routines keep you interested and challenged. if you’re lucky enough to be at the resort when Graham is there be sure to schedule a Reiki session with him, it’s life changing! Do yourself a favor and be sure to make Komune Resort your next vacation!!!","January 24, 2019","29    Komune Resort, Keramas Beach Bali

1665,"A treasured gem, a blissful stay, tailor made to meet a variety of personal desires and holidayers dreams come true!Review of Komune Resort, Keramas Beach BaliPending reviewWhether you're in need of a solo escape, a family get away with activities to suit the whole family, a romantic and indulgent couples escape - perhaps even a wedding? Or even a body, mind and soul health retreat complete with daily yoga, meditation, air conditioned gym facilities, and a huge selection of vegan friendly, gluten free, organic tummy happy foods and drinks to choose from at the health hub! Or if you're more inclined to a couple of scrumptious sliders and a couple of bintang or icey cold cocktails to wash them down at the beach club - what better way to wind down after a cracking day in the surf - break directly out the front of the resort ( actual proof of the massive air you just landed - as you partner can lazily watch you, fresh coconut in hand, from the beach side infinity pool) - Unless of course they have decided to spend a day of bliss in the Day Spa getting absolutely pampered! (My fav!)Honestly, there is something spectacular here for everyone!I have stayed at the Komune 3 times now, and it's safe to say - it's my absolute favorite place to stay in Bali! I've had a romantic get away there in the past, I've taken a mother and daughter trip, and the most recent - November 2018 - I came with my parents for a 2 week family get away (they too completely enthralled with our stay)There are a couple of room types you can stay in at the Komune with great deals and packages on offer as well - something to suit all types of stay. (Eat surf play package -great value for those wanting a bit of everything. and Yoga packages for those really into a health retreat).I have stayed in the *Resort rooms in the past - which are located a little down the back, are quiet and fairly private and are at a great rate for those on a budget.I've stayed in the *TS suites - which are a little more expensive than the resort rooms, relatively similar though slightly larger and a little closer.And my absolute FAAAVORITE!!!! the *beach front pool suites - ok a whole lot more expensive buuuut trust me - you'll kick yourself if you don't!! These rooms are situated facing the ocean and infinity pool so you feel quite connected to the livelyness of the beach club down the front yet private and quiet enough that you can watch the buzzing from a peaceful distance. You have a generous private pool and day bed out the front of your room (another tip - you can extend this if you're visiting with fam or friends and book the rooms next to each other - therefor elongating your private pools!) There is a large bath tub in your room with a privacy curtain you can draw across - with a variety of flower baths you can order to your room along with room service if you feel! And not to forget the incredibly indulgent floating breakfast you can order for your pool - just do it! Trust me!Other facilities of the resort that I haven't yet mentioned include:*Children free lap pool and day bed bungalows for some quiet time.*A giant fruit bowl skate park for the kiddies* A beach meditation and yoga shala and a jungle meditation and yoga shala.*An events roomAnd if the location and facilities didn't steal your heart (they certainly do mine!)The staff will! From the minute you walk in the door, you feel instantly at home, with warm welcoming and care. They are all so helpful, genuine and sincere, and are genuinely happy to be there - which is a point of difference I think really creates the special stay here. I'd like to give a special mention to everyone - though I'm not great with remembering so many names! Though there are a few staff members I can mention here :)Desak and Agung at reception - Thank you for going above and beyond to make our stay as special as you did and for giving us the best deals we have had EVER! We could have only wished for a holiday as special as we had with our budgets - but you guys achieved it for us! Thank you :)Agus manager of the beach club restaurant - Thank you my friend for always looking after us and going above and beyond - even outside of your usual duites to find us great deals, great travel and day trip tips and sharing your awesome music with us! it's great to have friends to chat to on our visits :)Dewa, Gex, Agus, Hendrix, Mega, Winda, Ryan, Ketut the awesome staff at the beach club restaurant,bar and health hub - You guys are just awesome! Thanks for making our stay so fun and having a laugh with us. You all made it so easy, relaxed and enjoyable. The food is impeccable - the best in Bali we've had! The drinks are fantastic and the service is always fabulous! You really don't need to go anywhere else to eat with so much selection - and trust me, you really won't want to! :)Windi, Sudi, Suci, Ayu, and I forgotten (apologies) the lovely man on front desk at the Day Spa - Thank you all so much for all of the love and care you put into your treatments - being a day spa owner and therapist myself, I know just how important and special this is - absolute bliss!and Rudi the wonderful and talented hair magician! Well people will just have to visit you to experience the pure magic and skill you posses! Thank you so much for looking after my family and I - you're a rare gem! :)We are thoroughly pleased with our visits and can't wait for our next visit to our home away from home","January 21, 2019","29    Komune Resort, Keramas Beach Bali

1666,"Amazing architecture and extensive grounds to explore backing onto a lovely black sand beach. Arriving at the resort, you will see the reception which is partly hidden under a terrace with a growing creeper. This is pretty much the theme of the place which is integrating nature into the resort as the gardens between the rooms is also somewhat wild and beautiful, making you feel like you are staying in a jungle. There are many corners to explore at this resort which include the vegetable gardens, a children's playground, the pool overlooking the beach, the gym, the 2 restaurants on site and the other outdoor relaxation pool. The second pool is so tucked away that I only managed to discover it a few hours before my departure, much to my disappointment. The pool overlooking the sea is an ideal spot to lounge around in or around on a sunny day asnd there are adequate options for doing so beside the pool. It is an ideal spot for people watching too as the beach is a popular spot for surfers too. The restaurant by the beach has a very beachy vibe and you can order refreshments from there when the waiters come around. The other restaurant on site, which is located closer to the gym is a dedicated organic restaurant with exquisite food and many options including local food. Portions were huge and we had a bit of trouble finishing what we ordered as we had ordered with such gusto. However, the flavour ensured we did eventually.The hotel even had a yoga or meditation hall or center which I didn't go to for any other reason that a quick visit to check it out. It was very secluded and hidden from view with lush planting around. The hotel made guests feel there was plenty to do by offering activities like free sessions with a trainer in the gym twice a day if you were up for it. It is also good to note that there were several different options of rooms to choose from and there was a block of ocean view rooms which looked really luxurious and very well designed. I did not get to see what the inside of these looked like but they were nice from the outside.Overall, it was a pleasant stay in a more out of the way location on Bali Island. If you came especially for the resort and set out to fully utilise the amenities on offer it is really worth it. However it is slightly further away from most other attractions and the motorbike rental is slightly more expensive as there are less options to choose from.","January 21, 2019","29    Komune Resort, Keramas Beach Bali

1667,"We had a family holiday at Komune in Sept 18, from the moment of arrival we were greeted with a welcome drink and wet towel & were continued to be spoilt our whole 5 day stay. We had the pool beach view rooms. The rooms are divine, from the lighting to the huge stacker doors opening onto the pool. We had 3 adjoining rooms so could swim the length of the 3 rooms. We also had our own sunken gazebo at one end where we sat and the breakfast watching the Balinese exercising on the beach. The front restaurant is awesome to sit and watch the waves you are so close the sea spray can use about wet your face. Staff were great always willing to give advice on day trips and general information about the area. We loved our stay. ","January 15, 2019","29    Komune Resort, Keramas Beach Bali

1669,"I stayed at the Komune Resort for 8 nights as part of a Love and Nourish yoga retreat with Anastasia Williams. The resort was a magical backdrop to the yoga and meditation. It is removed from the craziness of busy Bali up in Keramas on a black sand surf beach. Everything about the resort is geared to health and wellness, with a large gym, yoga offered in two shalas and two pools - one adults only, and one beach-side and great surfing. The menu offerings are healthy and superb, with a dedicated vegan menu. I've read some other reviews mention mosquitos, but personally I wasn't bothered by any and didn't get any bites. The staff were faultlessly friendly and warm. Being there over New Year I thought the resort would feel busy, but it never did and it was always easy to get a pool-side lounge. I'll most definitely be back!","January 6, 2019","29    Komune Resort, Keramas Beach Bali

1670,"What a place. We go to Bali twice a year and usually go to Seminyak, Nusa Dua, Bingin, Sanur or Jimaran. I have to admit that it has taken my surfing partner about 3 years to convince me to come up here as I was hesitant to go away from the buzz and clubs of Seminyak or the 5* hotels at Nusa Dua but our 5 day stay at this place was so beautiful and calming that I wanted to stay. Unfortunately they were booked out, so off we went to our 5* hotel at Nusa Dua, with 5* prices, 5* screaming kids with their nannies, greasy buffet food and I could go on but it will all be in another review.So what was so good here.The hotel website easy to navigate and offered extras like car from airport and massages to book in advanceWe usually get a cab but this was really easy and considering the distance to the airport it was ok value for money.It was very much a case of under promise and over deliver. We booked a suite with an ocean view which was modern, very clean, well serviced and very well laid out. There were always fresh towels and the communal lap pool in front is cordoned off so that people cannot swim past your room. You can see the ocean from your bed and there is another day bed and table and chairs outside on a patio.It was Christmas time so there were families and quite a few kids but it was almost like a Commune, many of the kids were playing together and everyone was really friendly. It was like one big family and many people had commented that they had been there numerous times. There was a family pool and beach club at the front which over looked one of the surf breaks. The staff were amazing. Balinese people are so lovely anyway but it looked like the staff were happy in their work, always smiling, they didn't look burn't out and they were always very careful to repeat your order.The food, just awesome. Very healthy and so many choices including vegetarian. And lots of fresh juices.And just when you think it is perfect enough, There is a whole adult area with adult lap pool and cabanas, a massive gym, a large Shala for Yoga and meditation, an area with another restaurant and a village green where you can just sit quietly after meditating and then there is the Spa with a lovely hair and nail salon, clothes store and massage rooms.We didn't leave the place until check out, although many people we met had drivers every day and visited other locations and other surf spots.Would we come back again - absolutely - can't wait.","January 5, 2019","29    Komune Resort, Keramas Beach Bali

1671,"Having just stayed in Seminyak for four nights, coming to Komune was absolutely what the soul required. We stayed in a beachside pool suite - overlooking the ocean - and found every element of this resort wonderful. The amenities, the staff, the food, the yoga and health hubs, the ease of walking on the strangely beautiful volcanic sand - it was a dream. Can't recommend Komune Resort highly enough!

1672,"This place is amazing. I don't think there is much they haven't thought of.Our travel style is typically boho chic boutique style or B&B / Homestay. We landed here to meet friends for a week of ""retreat"" with Daily Sweat's Strength & Culture Bali.We had already spent a little over a week exploring Amed and Gili Air. This resort is in the cut. Not much around but great central location for day trips. It is luxury eco-friendly with AMAZING food and drink, wellness centers (yes, with an 's') and spectacular beach views. The adult pool was quiet and perfect, though my husband and I are more beach than pool people, the beach here is really just for surfers and watchers. Get the room with the private pool if you can. Seriously. It changes the entire experience!The amenities are endless, the property is unbelievably well kept. CLEAN and Beautifully kept from landscape to technology. Brilliantly placed tall, big bright lights to illuminate the beach at night and draw the flying creatures. Frogs and gecko's on the grounds to help catch the flying pests. Fly spray is available at each venue. Multiple options for sit down to eat (although the menu's are pretty identical, which is not a bad thing since its all so good!The fruit juices... OMG.The staff is wonderful. If I were wanting some serious down time without much moving around in between stops, I'd be back in a heartbeat. Perfect for signles, couples and quiet families.It is however VERY quiet. If you and your group are not about that QUIET. Don't come here and disturb the peace. It would also be pretty embarrassing for you (as it was at some points for my group lol). We all loved it. They know how to take care of groups and there is nothing that cannot be accommodated.

Get the dragon bowl and incredible coconut milk raw cacao drink. Sweet helpful staff overall. Loved the rooms even though the single beds were fairly small, but comfortable none the less. Enjoyed that it was a great resort without the typical annoying feel of a resort — music at the main pool wasn’t too loud or obnoxious and the quiet pool was a little oasis (be mindful of the mosquitoes up there). Wish the beach had less trash but I think that is a typical island situation overall... still the black sand was lovely and it was a treat to watch the surfers. Gorgeous sunrise watching.

The menu at the health club is a mix of vegan, wholefoods and modern, which is done so well and great for people that are looking for healthy food that also appeals to foodies. Try the local Balinese coffee for pre workout :) our 5 year old son loved the main pool that's kids friendly. There's also a great muscle muscle outdoor gym too for ninja warriors. Surfing is literally at your doorstep too and the waves are amazing. Highly recommend this place for those looking for an alternative from the typical brand name resorts and boring buffets.

1679,"My favorite place in the world. Perfect place to stay for surfers looking to stay at a luxurious place with a world class wave. Eka and Abdi walked me trough the smoothest and easiest hotel check in I’ve ever had. My room was exquisite, with a huge comfy bed, luxury bath tub, private pool and beautiful ocean view! I was so happy to be able to see the waves when I woke up without even having to get out of my bed ! Komang Wijaya was awesome with helping me out with getting my laundry done and restocking my fridge. All the front desk workers were so awesome with accommodating me with whatever I needed. Ayu at the tour desk was great, she helped me rent a vehicle. Desak was a huge help too from helping me find a phone case to finding the best restaurants they were outstanding. Gus Ari, Juan, Lisna, Pawan, Nanda, Siwi, Budi , Surya and Gus De the bell boy were very very helpful as well! Over at the restaurant I was greeted with excellent service by Dewa , Eka and Agoes, Hendrik, De Juna and the girls working the hostess / cashier desk who I somehow for their names, maybe Ayu & Tiwi? (So sorry for the staff I forgot and couldn’t remember all your names). The spa was really good too. Out of all the massages I’ve had in Bali the ones I got here were the best. Big thanks to Ayu, Kadek , Komang and Windi for helping me relax and unwind. For when the waves get small I would head to the hotel’s private skatepark and skate the “fruit bowl” with the other skaters at the hotel. Love how they have really good skateboards that they let you use so you don’t have to bring one. Also the Boys at the beach club / lifeguards were definitely a highlight of my trip ! Gus De who runs the Warung was awesome along with Agunk , Adi , Lempog and Agus. The lifeguards would not only show me the best waves of the day and watch over everyone but they also would take time on their days off and take me around the island to show me their local markets, restaurants and my favorite , the monkeys. I also had the chance to meet the owner Mr. Tony Cannon who was a super nice guy whom all the staff here loved. He was surfing just about everyday and was a pleasure to surf with! Overall this place is by far the best hotel I’ve ever stayed at and will continue to stay here every time I’m in Bali. Thank you everyone at Komune Resort for the time of my life!

1683,"My happy beach home in Bali for the last 3 years. If you're looking for a healthy and fun beachfront paradise on a non-touristy, not crowded surf beach, Komune will blow your mind. Every time I come to Bali, I book one or two trips to Komune and I end up staying longer than I'd planned. I just can't get away... It has everything that a health enthusiast could want: yummy, delicious healthy food (they even have an additional all-vegan menu now!), yoga, surf, spa on site, beautiful facilities (try the beachfront suites) and the most lively, beachfront restaurant, where I spend hours writing and staring at the waves. You can also come and just enjoy the beach club during the day, as it's only a 30-minute drive from Ubud. But for a fuller experience, I recommend staying for at least a few nights. The best part about Komune is without a doubt the kind, amazing staff, always ready to help. They truly go out of their way to make sure you're well taken care of - even for picky people like myself -- and they end up feeling like extended family. They make a difference. I'd especially like to reference Abdi - one of the managers for helping me with my bookings and tending to my requests with the kindest, most professional attitude, for the last two years. Thank you Abdi for making my stay at Komune so memorable, every time I go. You're a superhero and it truly helps to have someone like you as a reference. I'd also like to thank Wayne, the general manager for his hospitality, kindness and always cheerful disposition, willing to fix any issue, and always putting the client's satisfaction first. Thanks so much, Komune! You keep getting better and better.","October 7, 2018","29    Komune Resort, Keramas Beach Bali
